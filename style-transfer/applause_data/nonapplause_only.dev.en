nonapplause I want to say a word about Afghanistan because it is ironic that I stand here to talk about September 11th  because September 11th  of course in many ways began in Afghanistan.
nonapplause But I want to start off mainly by saying thank you.
nonapplause You have made us all proud.
nonapplause Well that $3.8 billion shortfall grew to $6 billion.
nonapplause To me that is what our public life is all about.
nonapplause And working together with our NATO allies and others is another thing that the people of this region have found almost difficult to understand -- speaking of female officers.
nonapplause Assistant Federal prosecutor  Special Assistant to the United States Attorney General  District Court judge  judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  member of countless panels and commissions  including the leadership of the President's Commission on Organized Crime -- Judge Kaufman has brought to each his practical skills  his zeal for justice  and  again  that remarkable energy.

nonapplause You recall  if you listened to our television debates  that this was a major point of issue.
nonapplause And I will make the case tomorrow night that it's within our grasp to do so.
nonapplause And if you don't believe me  I have two words for you: Smoot-Hawley.
nonapplause And now if I may raise a glass to the relationship between the United States and the Republic of India and also to the American and Indian people who share values and bonds of kinship.
nonapplause And there's no way in the world we'll be able to convince our friends in India or China  which over the next 30 years will become bigger emitters of greenhouse gases than we are  that they can take a different path to development  and that we're not trying to keep them poor  unless we can demonstrate that we have let this idea go and that we have evidence that a different way will work.
nonapplause We have the acting director of our Office of National Drug Control Policy  Ed Jurith  Zina Pierre and others here who have worked with you.
nonapplause In this case  it's lead to the employment of 2 3 000 000 people in administrative jobs in health insurance companies and health providers  whose main job is either try to get the money or try to keep from giving it a little longer and catch the float.

nonapplause It's good to see Congresswoman Karen McCarthy.
nonapplause And I want to thank Nancy Keenan from Montana for running.

nonapplause No one does.
nonapplause realizing that a man cannot ride your back unless it is bent.
nonapplause As the President has said  the terrorists will continue to have the coward's power to plant roadside bombs and to recruit suicide bombers.
nonapplause And our energy plan for a stronger America -- our energy plan will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future  so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
nonapplause In fact  we can give a bigger future to our children.
nonapplause They're in school  there's no drop-out rate  there is no violence in the school  there are no weapons in the school; the kids are learning  an extraordinary percentage of them are going on to college.
nonapplause There are new worlds on the horizon  and we're not going to stop until we get them all together.
nonapplause Thank you  and God bless you.
nonapplause But increasingly in this new era  we will need to work an array of multinational partners often in new arrangements.

nonapplause As President Medvedev has rightly said  a mature and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic development.
nonapplause You know  I used to be a Democrat myself.
nonapplause Next Sunday night  it's our intention to go into the present  some of the tricks that are used to keep us at the level that we are on by making us think that we're going forward when we are actually standing still.
nonapplause Indeed  we made a number of adjustments to respond to the stated concerns of the Soviet side.
nonapplause These Hispanic members of the administration are not picked because of their ethnic background.
nonapplause They have clearly boosted economic growth.
nonapplause But we never really reached behind that to strike at the heart of the organization that was responsible for those attacks.
nonapplause I tried to go and talk to him.
nonapplause I just want to ask you  what advice do you have for workers as the election approaches  particularly for workers who are trying to organize to have a voice on the job?

nonapplause You represent what we believe in  in democracy and freedom.
nonapplause That was how families balanced back then.
nonapplause You will want to talk peace with us.
nonapplause We have to make sure that we create early learning opportunities.
nonapplause This is what happens when you back away from the moral premises of your way of life.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause As we watch and encourage reforms in the region  we are mindful that modernization is not the same as Westernization.
nonapplause And trusted not least by our partners in the European Community.
nonapplause All right  thank you.
nonapplause So they continue committing acts of random horror  believing they can intimidate the civilized world and break the will of the American people.
nonapplause We need to get that message out there loud and clear: no one should be afraid to help another company to deal with this challenge.
nonapplause Because there's no certainty in a future where premiums rise without limit; there's certainly no certainty where companies are forced to drop coverage or cut back elsewhere.
nonapplause And he boldly asserted that freedom -- freedom was the right of men and women on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
nonapplause I said that wrong.
nonapplause These 62 waivers -- let me just give you an idea of what that means -- that compares with a total of 24 in the previous two administrations  and there's more on the way.
nonapplause Nearly every community of conscience and faith has more to share  and corporate and foundation America can give more and give wiser.
nonapplause Thank you  Governor Carnahan  for your leadership on so many areas and your friendship.
nonapplause So after the ceremony  we all went back  we were dripping wet  and we went back to the apartment at the library.
nonapplause And we don't need to be ashamed of it  either.
nonapplause He'd say - It's the same thing  of course  in each bottle; just put a different label on it  but he'd pass it out  and  you know  it would work pretty well.
nonapplause I read the other day that in New York it can cost as much as $200 000 to dismiss a teacher who is incompetent.
nonapplause So I am directing Secretary Shalala to work in partnership with higher education to prepare training materials for medical researchers.

nonapplause On the broader picture  Senator Kerry has questioned whether the war on terror is really a war at all.
nonapplause My fellow Americans  four years ago when the people of Wisconsin gave Bill Clinton and Al Gore a chance to lead the country  we had a simple message.
nonapplause That may have been all right in those times when we had full employment.
nonapplause Although  if you can gain your freedom  do so.
nonapplause And I'd like to think that we touched the hearts and minds of the neighborhood families whose lives we helped change.
nonapplause If you buy into the federal health insurance plan  there's a lot of us.
nonapplause They didn't ask for them in the first place.

nonapplause Most of all  I would like to express my respect to the families who are here today from Kosovo; and my very special thanks for those who met earlier with Chancellor Schroeder and me.
nonapplause Their lives will be richer and better.
nonapplause What are their chances of being unemployed if they are working as laborers?
nonapplause And that's why the post-1911 -- 9/11 GI Bill must give today's veterans the skills and training they need to fill the jobs of tomorrow.
nonapplause De Tocqueville noted that "wherever  at the head of some new undertaking  you see the government in France  or a man of rank in England  in the United States you will be sure to find an association."
nonapplause In recent years  our forces have served together in Afghanistan and Iraq  and Japan has been one of the largest donors toward the reconstruction effort in those two countries.
nonapplause Do you want Ken Kramer as your Senator from the great State of Colorado?
nonapplause If you were going to list the hundred most popular things that I have done as President  being married to Michelle Obama is number one.
nonapplause With our adversary arming totalitarian forces to the teeth  we must have the courage to give those who share our ideals  especially those in this hemisphere  what they need to defend themselves and to win the day.
nonapplause I thank the Mayor of Monterey and all the state and city and county officials who are here.
nonapplause By the same token  the simplicity of many of his pronouncements  which are often misinterpreted as evidence that he has penetrated to the core of a complex issue  are in fact exactly the opposite because they usually mark his refusal to even consider complexity.
nonapplause Are you going to find a new star  or a cure for a disease?
nonapplause And many Ghanaians  indeed  I can say without any fear of contradiction  that all Ghanaians want to see you.
nonapplause The year 2030 may seem like a long way off  and in politics there is always a temptation to kick the can down the road -- hoping that long-term problems might simply disappear  or leaving them for someone else to worry about.
nonapplause Now  I noticed my Department of Homeland Security Secretary --   -- is kind of horning in on our event here.
nonapplause Iraqis who refuse to fight for the regime are being murdered.
nonapplause What is it that we're really  really about?
nonapplause And the reason I bring this up is that it's an indication of why this future -- our relationship is just as strong in the future as it is today.
nonapplause She's 36 years old.
nonapplause And that's exactly what we've done.
nonapplause And we seek to modernize  thirdly  our education system to foster economic growth and competitiveness now and into the future.
nonapplause We were growing together and going forward.
nonapplause You've made us very  very  happy and we'd like to come out and say hello to you in time for this plane to leave.
nonapplause Because the American people aren't getting fooled.
nonapplause The air is cleaner; the water is cleaner; the food is safer.
nonapplause Already the two main genetic markers for  that are high predictors of breast cancer have been identified.

nonapplause I almost fell out of my chair laughing.
nonapplause We heard from Alan Patrikoff about his innovative ideas on developing venture capital in Africa.
nonapplause And it is a fascinating thing.
nonapplause But in many of the important regions of the world  active conflicts take innocent lives  stunt economic growth  and block social progress.
nonapplause And I want you to continue and I want this model to sweep the country.
nonapplause At its edges  this struggle is not so much between good and evil  between absolute freedom and immediate slavery; but between hope and despair  between those who shoulder the promise and the burden of freedom and those who would -- in the name of a false determinism -- take us a mile or two more down what Friedrich Hayek called the road to serfdom.
nonapplause Thank you for welcoming us here today.
nonapplause And I don't think it's good economics  but I know it doesn't create a world of shared responsibilities and shared benefits.
nonapplause Under this theory  the president's authority when acting as commander in chief or when making foreign policy cannot be reviewed by the judiciary  cannot be checked by Congress.
nonapplause So that's what it's not about.
nonapplause And  ultimately  both economic success and human dignity depend on the rule of law and honest administration of justice.
nonapplause All these things sound so far away sometimes  here in Syracuse  or in Erie or in Lancaster  but  my friends  we can have the best social security and the best housing and the best jobs and it will make no difference if statesmanship fails to avoid the next war.
nonapplause Together  we will safeguard the most sensitive areas  permit sustainable fishing and eco-tourism and others  and enable native Hawaiians to honor their age-old traditions.
nonapplause And our country extends a warm welcome  and we hope you have a great stay.
nonapplause The Christians and the Jews.
nonapplause So  they have a real stake in that part of the program.
nonapplause You heard some already  and it's all true.
nonapplause I'm proud to say that during these last 4 years  not 1 square inch of territory in the world has been lost to Communist aggression.
nonapplause Number one  one of the biggest fights I have all the time convincing people on both sides is that America has to find a way to protect the environment and grow the economy  and that if we have to choose one or the other  we're in deep trouble.
nonapplause They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States.
nonapplause And along with the American Academy of Pediatrics  the American Hospital Association  the National Association of Education  all have launched their own efforts to target and enroll uninsured children.
nonapplause If He has a place and part for me  I am ready."

nonapplause I understand the Mayor of Belleville  Illinois  Roger Cook is here.
nonapplause Effective enforcement of our nation's fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity.
nonapplause In the current phase of the war on terrorism  we are focused on disrupting terrorist operations  dismantling terrorist groups and cells  denying sanctuaries  and deterring future action.
nonapplause I was proud as a member of the House of Representatives to support President Reagan in those efforts  and I'm even prouder to support our President today as he cuts taxes to stimulate economic growth  increases defense spending and acts to win the war on terror and to protect our homeland.
nonapplause It has been dedicated by long practice to that wise and beneficent policy.
nonapplause You've reacted with compassion for those that were in need.
nonapplause And that's real leadership.
nonapplause Much has been said and written about the high rate with these last few years of small business failures  but not so much has been said about the other side of the coin.
nonapplause And now you have before you great opportunities and  with them  a greatÿ7Eÿ7E adventure ÿ7Eÿ7E the ÿ7Eÿ7Eadventureÿ7Eÿ7E of helpingÿ7Eÿ7E toÿ7Eÿ7E takeÿ7Eÿ7E Americaÿ7Eÿ7E intoÿ7Eÿ7E the 21st century.
nonapplause Now  some people will have made the case that -- and I keep getting this -- I got it today from some reporter who called me up  and he's saying  "But it has been accepted as law in the country that the judiciary has the ultimate say on the Constitution."
nonapplause I've heard  for example  that all four high schools have sent student ambassadors to the Soviet Union  that your schools on all levels have outstanding records for academic achievement  and that in the trade programs you were world class champions in the 1988 Skills Olympics.
nonapplause I already knew only too well the task that faced me.
nonapplause In my hometown of Birmingham  Alabama  the legacy and the birthmark of slavery persisted for a century in the brutal and dehumanizing form of segregation.
nonapplause Amongst a variety of topics  one of which is going to be  we're going to talk about the budget and my speech tomorrow night to the Congress.
nonapplause This is a big issue.
nonapplause I mean  admittedly  Blackmun kind of paid literal lip service to the Constitution.
nonapplause Today  NATO is in Afghanistan.
nonapplause And very rarely do societies have the luxury of being financially strong enough  militarily secure enough and having enough information about the future to make the kind of decisions that I asked the American people to make last night.
nonapplause Let's take Procter & Gamble.
nonapplause We passed the Patriot Act that gave law enforcement tools that were already available for prosecuting drug traffickers and organized crime  now made them available for prosecuting terrorists.
nonapplause But let us accept no proposals which would tip the balance of power still further against the West.
nonapplause We were attacked viciously on 9/11.
nonapplause Weapons of mass destruction  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  terrorism  and I would include a third that does not yet play in this quite as well and as much as needs to and that is dealing with a cycle of despair that represents about a third of the world.
nonapplause We've done a lot of work with the 401(k) plans and other things; we need to do more.
nonapplause Our enemies are evil and they're ruthless.
nonapplause In all the decisions that will come over the next two years  it's going to matter a great deal which party has the majority on the floor and controls the gavel in committee.
nonapplause So if you just go back  here we are with this -- a whole future before us  with all these opportunities up there  and you should be happy.
nonapplause And I say this with all due respect to the few people who are engaged in journalism and media work who may be decent  but most of them are just incompetent.
nonapplause These were our times.
nonapplause It means at least that we must continue to be the world's leading force for peace and freedom  against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
nonapplause It pays for their nursing home care  for in-home care to avoid the costs of going to nursing homes and for hospital care.
nonapplause Girls who are educated have more economic and social resources to rely on  and  therefore  have more power to negotiate their own sexual lives.
nonapplause Our biggest county  Los Angeles County  now has over 160 different racial and ethnic groups within one county.
nonapplause By making critical seed money available  we've attracted more than $280 billion in investment from private companies and others  which will mean new jobs and brighter futures for families in Holland and in communities across the country.
nonapplause Now let me speak for a minute about one of the things I just mentioned.
nonapplause They'll have elections in January.
nonapplause I wonder if I could take a second -- I didn't intend to do this and I've told it to some other people before.
nonapplause And what a MARVELLOUS investment  not only in the building  but in the staff and the students here.
nonapplause We made sure that they could get health insurance if they were looking for a job  because COBRA was too expensive; reduced the cost of it by 65 percent.
nonapplause Where did we stand?
nonapplause The first leads inevitably and inexorably to Smoot-Hawley.
nonapplause An opportunity society  reaching for its future with confidence  sustained by faith  fair play  and a conviction that good and courageous people will flourish when they're free -- this is our vision of a strong and prosperous America  at peace with itself and the world.
nonapplause Next  we will keep working to build one America at home -- to make a strength of our diversity so that other nations can be inspired to overcome their own ethnic and religious tensions.
nonapplause The fact that an agreement is near which may make such a war so much less likely is a signal of hope to all mankind.
nonapplause You may have heard recently about something called the e-rate.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy  Barrington School
nonapplause Now  the question is  what is the best way to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers in ways that do not either rob those people who need it of their secure retirement  or impose intolerable burdens on our children  who  in turn  will be burdened in raising our grandchildren.
nonapplause They had kids that had to walk to school through neighborhoods that were invested by gangs.
nonapplause It costs about $100 billion per year.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech by President to Northeastern University Community
nonapplause I'd like to thank Ambassador Lavin for his kind and generous introduction.
nonapplause We all agree about this.
nonapplause That  to me  is the critical thing.
nonapplause Because there were two great questions: One was the economic and attendant social change going on in America as we moved from farm to factory  from rural areas to cities and to an ever more diverse population with more and more immigrants coming into our cities  looking for jobs in those factories.
nonapplause We know full well the nature of the enemy we are dealing with.
nonapplause They called the 80's the decade of greed; do you know what the 90's is?
nonapplause That kind of compassion has been duplicated all over the country  and it symbolizes the best tradition of caring.
nonapplause So politics matters  and even if you are a former president there are some things that we can accomplish for the common good only through the common instrument of our elected officials.
nonapplause Destroy it  and you have undermined that incubator of true self-respect which is what  in the end  allows us--each and every one--to stand before a world that knows not who we are  with the sure certainty that God knows us  for we have felt His hand  and we have known His love.
nonapplause It must be earned.
nonapplause In addition to supporting his own children  he cares for six children left by his two sisters  who died of AIDS.
nonapplause More recently  he failed to repudiate the Reverend Jesse Jackson  when he went to Havana  stood with Fidel Castro  and cried: "Long live Cuba!
nonapplause We had riots in the street.
nonapplause And we're going to fight to keep inflation down  so farmers and ranchers aren't buried again by out of control production costs.
nonapplause In the 12 years before I took office  trickle-down economics led to an explosion in the federal deficit which quadrupled our national debt in only 12 years.
nonapplause Now  this is a very important election.
nonapplause What contribution did it make to REA?
nonapplause At the same time  our coalition is building up the infrastructure to improve both security and living conditions in Afghanistan.
nonapplause I told Julianne Moore and Jack Stahl  and I want to thank Revlon for what they've done to support this evening.
nonapplause The President.
nonapplause Its reduction has a claim not only on the political energy of the Government  but on the moral energy of the people.
nonapplause We need to know whether the teachers  the methodology that teachers use is working.
nonapplause And I understand Nebraska's doing even better than that.
nonapplause Over the last 20 years  too many of our schools have abandoned their music  their arts and their psychical education programs.
nonapplause As president  I will ask the hard questions and demand hard evidence.
nonapplause It's about the values that have made America the greatest  freest nation on Earth -- as Lincoln said  "the last best hope" of humanity.
nonapplause The troops who are there are incredible  every single one of them.
nonapplause We want schools to get more aid  but we want to turn around these schools or put them under new management  because we know we can turn schools around.
nonapplause Was it a nuisance six years ago when they simultaneously blew up two of our embassies in East Africa?
nonapplause We offered an honorable compromise.
nonapplause When you are the exceptional country  that kind of globalism could mean that you're going to be brought down to the lower standard that is the rule for most humanity.
nonapplause And I'd also like to thank the people who came with the Asrayon Project that the Prime Minister has founded.
nonapplause We should not delude ourselves into thinking for an instant that because Brown represents the law  we have achieved our goal  that the work of Brown is done  when there are those who still seek  in different ways  to see it undone  to roll back affirmative action  to restrict equal rights  to undermine the promise of our Constitution.
nonapplause On the other hand  the greatest threat to our security comes out of our interdependence  our vulnerability everywhere to enemies from within.
nonapplause I'd also like to say a special word of appreciation for two of your members for working on issues that we share a common concern about -- Joe Gorman  who's chairing your session on education; and Larry Perlman  who's chairing the work force development section and discussing the reemployment act that he's helping us to work on and about which I wish to talk today.
nonapplause Drugs violate our borders when smugglers bring them in as illegal cargo.
nonapplause Colorado has good and talented people on both sides of the aisle.
nonapplause Thank you so much for joining us.
nonapplause Thank you all for coming out.
nonapplause And the other health challenges.
nonapplause Where government involvement is necessary  its aim should be to support a predictable  consistent  legal environment for trade and commerce to flourish on fair and understandable terms.
nonapplause You know it really is pretty common sense in New Hampshire I would think.
nonapplause We got out from under the thrall of a government which we had hoped would make our lives better  but which turned out to try to live our lives for us.
nonapplause There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights  "When will you be satisfied?"
nonapplause We want to create the infrastructure for the future -- not just roads and bridges -- but also the broadband lines and the smart grid lines that will ensure we stay competitively on top for years to come  creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs all across the country in the process.
nonapplause But in the end  as First Lady  this isn't just a policy issue for me.
nonapplause And it's tough to hang out there and play with your friends  it's hard to keep up in school if you're not healthy.
nonapplause It's amazing  it's really been -- so  now  my family has a new candidate  my party has a new leader  and I have become the Cheerleader-In-Chief  and I like it.
nonapplause I want to tell you something.
nonapplause Inevitably  Al D'Amato and I haven't agreed on everything.
nonapplause Right now  countries like China and India and South Korea and Germany  they are fighting as hard as they can for the jobs of the future.
nonapplause I was up there when I was helping clear the trail  somebody said they were from Fredericksburg  Texas  which reminded me of a story  a true story that happened to me.
nonapplause I favor giving the president fast track authority.
nonapplause And the waste that is left behind -- the waste that is left behind could be used to make small bombs with many times the destructive power of the bomb that blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
nonapplause But forgive me  I've decided to call it a Fritz-flop.
nonapplause We will also implement recommendations of our Task Force on Victims of Crime  which will report to me this week.
nonapplause It seemed to me that the answer was that we ought to look at government as our partner in building the American future  and that the role of government ought to be to give the tools to solve their own problems  to build strong communities and families  and to create the conditions in which that could be possible.
nonapplause And you deserve a lot of credit for pointing it out.
nonapplause As many of you heard  Jill couldn't be here because her son Beau was admitted to the hospital yesterday  but he is expected to make a full recovery  and our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Biden family.
nonapplause These 10 years have proven him right.
nonapplause As extraordinary an accomplishment as that is  we know that this transition won't be without problems.
nonapplause And that's why we made sure the Recovery Act focused on helping small businesses expand and create jobs.
nonapplause Thank you very much  Congressman.
nonapplause We cannot permit a cruel hoax to then be written into the law saying  well  you can get this block grant for police and prevention  but only after the prison money is spent and then have conditions on spending the prison money so strict that it will never be spent in the first place.
nonapplause That is how you can make sure the dreams of every parent in America can be achieved.
nonapplause You're a little tired  but you're glad for the opportunity to make a living  while helping this country become the most productive  innovative economy in the world.
nonapplause Changes were made; people were dismissed.
nonapplause And I call on America's G8 partners to follow through on their financial commitments so that we can stop proliferation at one of its sources.
nonapplause Many of you will be there and thank you for coming  not only here but there as well.
nonapplause And they'll tell you that there are thousands of law enforcement officers in every corner of this nation who are just as brave  just as dedicated and just as capable as they are -– and who would do the same thing if given the opportunity.
nonapplause I know it's often said that the once-proud party of Harry Truman is dead and gone  that the left has taken over its leadership and now defines it  especially its liberal leadership in Congress -- an old label on a new and very different package.
nonapplause They've broken through the barriers of hatred and fear.
nonapplause Cellular phones today can surf the World Wide Web.
nonapplause And the woman we honor today should know  America will also be a friend to freedom in Burma -- a friend for as long as it takes to reach the goal for which she has sacrificed so very much.
nonapplause The Welsh economy is growing and expanding.
nonapplause You guys design 40 communities that will get the special tax treatment the way you want it  we'll have 40 that work the way we think would work best.
nonapplause And we will continue to work together to change the tone in Washington  D.C.  by focusing on the people's business and by focusing on results.
nonapplause Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons -- that's hard.
nonapplause But in its first year of operation only 33 acres of the land acquired by local authorities were resold to developers.
nonapplause Kit  we really need you in Washington.
nonapplause And that role is especially important in tough economic times.
nonapplause A recent survey of small businesses shows rising optimism among owners  evidence of improving sales  and more plans to invest and hire new workers.
nonapplause I want all our kids to be like the kids here at Brock.
nonapplause You know  there's a balance that can be struck  and the key principle is sustainability.
nonapplause A trillion dollars would be a stack of thousand-dollar bills 67 miles high.
nonapplause We're keeping the doors of the opportunity society wide open by cutting tax rates still further and spurring on the economic expansion that has already created about 11\1/2\ million new jobs.
nonapplause Chief  thank you for letting us be here in your beautiful part of the country.
nonapplause Partly because of these teams  we expect to ship more grain to Brazil and Morocco and to maintain near record grain exports to the People's Republic of China.
nonapplause Now  let me say just a word about the choice we're going to make on November 2nd  because I don't believe  frankly  that if -- based on John Kerry's record in the United States Senate  and based on what he said during the course of the campaign  I don't believe he would pursue a strategy as effective as the one the President has selected with respect to prosecuting the war on terror  and doing it with respect to the United States.
nonapplause And what's happened to your tax money is  the deficit keeps going up even though defense has gone down because of the cost of health care -- something that won't surprise any of you.
nonapplause It sounds good.
nonapplause And if they can't see a connection between what you are doing and their lives getting better in the short term as well as the long term  then it's very hard to get any traction over time.
nonapplause There was Jared's perseverance.

nonapplause I think we should extend our moratorium on e-commerce.
nonapplause And I think that makes him a better legislator  because if you think about how something's going to work  you're more likely to vote for the right kind of bills and draft them in the right way.
nonapplause This is an incredible country that we have been given and we happen to have been given the responsibility to live in this country at a remarkable moment in history.
nonapplause It was doing well  but he told the Vice President that his company couldn't grow and thrive without technical assistance and better training  without tools and skills his larger competitors already had.
nonapplause Now  if we all know that  why in the world would we ever do anything to make it harder to go on to college or to stay in college or to discourage people from taking out college loans?
nonapplause For children who lost everything  their homes  their belongings  and their friends  going to school can be a place where they find stability and a familiar routine.
nonapplause We can grow food to feed our own people.
nonapplause We lost more lives that day than we lost at Pearl Harbor.
nonapplause Keep that in mind.
nonapplause Because of what you have done  America is working again -- with the longest peacetime expansion in history  the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957  nearly 18 million new jobs  the lowest welfare rolls in three decades.
nonapplause GM  by the way  has 30 more days  because their restructuring is more thoroughgoing than what was required with Chrysler.
nonapplause I would like to share with you some notes taken from my husband's pockets upon his death.
nonapplause Again  this is a system that no other country has.
nonapplause We didn't ask for the attack  but it came.
nonapplause Yes  it is true that the science does not definitively tell us that global warming increases the frequency of hurricanes - because yes  it is true there is a multi-decadal cycle  twenty to forty years that profoundly affects the number of hurricanes that come in any single hurricane season.

nonapplause He was the last Democrat I voted for.
nonapplause And the genomics experts said  but what I want you to understand is that of all the possible permutations among people with all many  many parts of every gene  99.9 percent of us is identical to that of every other human being.
nonapplause It could change as well even if the Republican governor takes my place because the legislature is 87 percent Democratic and the Democratic party in my state has pledged as part of its platform same sex marriage.
nonapplause But the one area I wanted to focus on in particular was the national security area  because I think it is extraordinarily important  because I think we're going through one of those periods in our history when we're putting in place a new strategy  if you will  that's going to be crucial to safeguarding the nation and protecting our country in the years ahead.
nonapplause They're carrying on your legacy of sacrifice and service.
nonapplause We don't have an option of living with inflation and its attendant tragedy  millions of productive people willing and able to work but unable to find a buyer for their work in the job market.
nonapplause Because  I've read the statistics: about six percent of the criminals seem to account for seventy or seventy-five percent of the crime!
nonapplause During his first term  Mike has distinguished himself as a passionate advocate for Indiana's families.
nonapplause I am grateful for you being here.
nonapplause He's a lot better performer than I'll ever be.
nonapplause This is one reason real take-home pay for the average American is up  poverty has declined 2 years in a row  the average lifespan continues to expand  and our standard of living is on the upswing.
nonapplause You can make it happen.
nonapplause So today  let me just say  on behalf of the President  on behalf of the entire nation  what it means for us  what you do every day  the heavy lifting that's involved  the long hours  the dangerous missions  the time away from home  it's what our freedom is all about.
nonapplause And of course in the Christian New Testament Jesus says  the greatest commandment is to love God with all your heart  but the next is  quote  “like unto it  to love your neighbor as yourself.”
nonapplause The best source of information and intelligence in the war on terror is the terrorists  themselves  and we've obtained from captured terrorists information that has helped us stop a number of attacks planned to take place inside this country.
nonapplause I can't let my child go to the park unless I go with him.

nonapplause So I want to thank you guys for coming and for sharing this with us.
nonapplause On the other hand  Chinese tariffs will fall by more than half over five years in every sector -- from telecommunications to automobiles  to agriculture.

nonapplause That's the America I want you to help me build for the new century.
nonapplause And we must not let our guard down.
nonapplause To make the most of this new world  we both must change.
nonapplause It is wrong to let the people who won the Cold War lose the peace afterward.

nonapplause The American people don't want his tax increases  and he's not going to get them.
nonapplause In the last six months  it has to be said  certain successes were achieved  for example the abolition of controls on the movements of capital.
nonapplause A young seminarian  Karol Wojtyla  saw the swastika flag flying over the ramparts of Wawel Castle.

nonapplause Gerald Ford once said that he never could have imagined that he would be President of the United States in America's bicentennial year.
nonapplause This may be the last step in a process that began when people first came out caves in clans.
nonapplause That is good news.
nonapplause I've got to stop there  otherwise I'm going to be using up all my time.
nonapplause So  let's go out there in this last few weeks of this campaign with optimism and determination.
nonapplause If there is a right to strike  there is also a right to go to work.
nonapplause But you know what little embarrassment they were dealing with at the time?
nonapplause Having the right perspective means having the right context.
nonapplause What about that?
nonapplause I will set out the details of this economic plan in the weeks ahead.
nonapplause Now  we must see that the period of transition which you have lived through ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace  and people realize their aspirations for dignity  security  and a better life for their children.
nonapplause It's one of the main reasons the economy has gone from shrinking by 6 percent to growing at about 6 percent.
nonapplause We also have to make a world with more partners and fewer terrorists.
nonapplause Once again  I want to thank all of you for your commitment to the cause we all share.
nonapplause It's a priceless wonder.
nonapplause And the truth is  is that parents are busy and struggling and working hard  many of them working multiple jobs.
nonapplause We are  and proudly so  but we are also the keepers of the flame of liberty.
nonapplause We Californians saw it happen in the years of the last liberal administration in our State.
nonapplause The potential for theft of nuclear materials  therefore  increased.
nonapplause Six.
nonapplause The President's objective for our country is a healthy  growing economy  one that continues to generate good-paying jobs for workers all across the country.
nonapplause We need to guarantee American workers a fair shake.
nonapplause The health care system.

nonapplause Last week  I met Carla Mannes at a community college meeting I was hosting in Arizona.
nonapplause Thank you  Ken Duberstein  and thank you all very much.
nonapplause It will be uneasy peace because the Communists will make it uneasy.
nonapplause So  I thank you all once again for being here  and I thank you all for this report.
nonapplause They were not told the truth.
nonapplause About where it is obvious and easy and where it is difficult and uncertain.
nonapplause you got some Green Bay people over there  I heard.
nonapplause One of the things I confess I did not fully appreciate until I became President was how dangerous the day-in and day-out  year-in and year-out work of our military -- just training  just doing the defense of our country is  and our citizens should know that.
nonapplause It's like the corporate responsibility I saw today when corporate Charlotte was working to help people find jobs and find work  understanding that in work they find dignity.
nonapplause Some are skeptical that the war on terror is really a war at all.
nonapplause And I know that can be frustrating  especially when your generation has grown up in a popular culture that doesn't exactly value all your hard work and commitment  but instead it glorifies easy answers  and instant gratification  and quick celebrity.
nonapplause But I'm telling you  there are big differences here.
nonapplause So the country has a big interest in who wins here.
nonapplause It was the Conservatives.
nonapplause Well  he's pretty close.
nonapplause You know  if you go into city after city after city  you will see  as my good friend Congressman John Lewis says  that environmental justice can be a civil rights issue.
nonapplause Now  I know our leaders have a tendency to forget it.
nonapplause If you just judge by appearances  if you just judge on the basis of what you can see  and touch  and feel  and measure  those signs of the material world would suggest that we're not a people at all--we're just a motley crew of multicultural diversities.
nonapplause A spirit of pessimism  totally inconsistent with the American character  permeated the land.
nonapplause You can't just isolate one body of knowledge or one experience from another.
nonapplause It will help heavily indebted poor countries to help themselves and help to build a framework to support similar and important efforts by the IMF  the World Bank and international financial institutions.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks on the Program for Economic Recovery at a White House Reception for Business and Government LeadersJune 11  1981
nonapplause You know  the word "Congressman" is not correct; it's "Representative."
nonapplause We are for the working families  not those at the very top.
nonapplause We must also recognize that our own economic well-being is inextricably linked to the world economy.
nonapplause It's part of strengthening public education.
nonapplause I was a fairly young member  which made it all the more impressive that Dan  who was even younger at 31  was already in his second term in the House.
nonapplause I'll tell you what my generation wants  I believe.
nonapplause And part of that incredible good is that the promise of America extend its reach into every single neighborhood.
nonapplause I hope and pray Congress will follow your lead  as well.
nonapplause So  what do you say: Do you think you can add a new name to the classic team of Martin  East  and Helms?
nonapplause You might think this is all very economic.
nonapplause The other thing that you've got to understand in Washington is that you hear a lot of debate about the deficit  and it's an important debate  don't get me wrong.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at the Rescissions Bill Signing
nonapplause I believed that we could unite the country and move it forward  that we could build that bridge to the 21st century based on opportunity and responsibility and a sense of community.
nonapplause You know  I get a great deal of pressure many times when I have an opportunity to speak to young people.
nonapplause But raising taxes at this time will hurt the recovery and is exactly the wrong medicine as we meet this stage of our economic cycle.
nonapplause So  today  we must fully acknowledge  once and for all  that America's culture of violence is having a profound effect on our children  and we must resolve to do what we can to change that culture.
nonapplause We have seen a sharp decline in agricultural income.
nonapplause National security is the one area where the duties are greatest  the work is hardest  and the margin for error is the smallest.
nonapplause Our budget does it.
nonapplause That's still not enough  but we're headed in the right direction  and we'll make progress.
nonapplause The Socialist Group and the European Parliament remain prepared to act in accordance with the European vision and to look towards the future.
nonapplause That doesn't have anything to do with an incident of several weeks ago.
nonapplause This proposal creates a fund to provide grants to new and existing community-based lenders.
nonapplause And I know that she's also an old friend of Al and Tipper Gore's  and they're grateful  too  for her contributions.
nonapplause Let me begin by thanking my good friend  Bob Scully  and Don Johnson and all the other law enforcement officials who are here and those throughout the nation for their support.
nonapplause There have been times in the United States of America when populations were marginalized.
nonapplause They now have a plan.
nonapplause It's also about being able to juggle the needs of our families with the demands of our jobs.
nonapplause Iraq's political leaders are steady and courageous  and the citizens  police  and soldiers have stepped forward as active participants and guardians of the new democracy -- running for office  speaking out  voting by the millions  and sacrificing for the future of their country.
nonapplause I look forward to seeing you all individually.
nonapplause They are also prepared to use weapons of mass destruction if they can ever get their hands on them.
nonapplause In the last five years alone  over five million Americans have lost their health insurance coverage.
nonapplause I think it is.
nonapplause Once again  the leaders of the Republican majority are polluting our spending bills with special interest riders that would promote overcutting in our forests  allow mining companies to dump more toxic waste on public land  and give a huge windfall to companies producing oil on federal lands.
nonapplause And the father explained.
nonapplause The point is that if we are meeting our responsibilities  in this country  if we are educating our children--
nonapplause Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard.
nonapplause Ok?
nonapplause First time that ever happened.
nonapplause I appreciate my friend  Mercer Reynolds  who is the national fundraising chairman for Bush-Cheney.
nonapplause They are the things that Jim Harvey wants.
nonapplause Only in America have in the last 10 years  we seen the work of clerical workers in the hospitals grow at four times the rate of new doctors and health care providers.
nonapplause And defense is very important.
nonapplause I missed about a week now.
nonapplause There were bleak days.
nonapplause And as you do  you will have partners in all the nations of NATO.
nonapplause Instead  by giving a disproportionate amount of that first tax cut and a hugely disproportionate amount of this tax cut to people in my income group  what we're really going to do is pay for that tax cut out of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
nonapplause There she was at home; she didn't know what to do.
nonapplause George's dad said  "For Goodness sake  Barbara  he's the President of the United States."
nonapplause These are elected officials who had access to the intelligence materials.
nonapplause I'm not suggesting the government should mandate it  but we should talk about it.
nonapplause We in the industrial democracies have forged a clear sense of purpose for our economic and military safety.
nonapplause Or  if you have tax relief  somebody is not going to get a Social Security check.
nonapplause It's wonderful to be here this morning.
nonapplause What a great day to be a soldier.
nonapplause Much of the work on the Cathedral  which you have just seen  was carried out by another Frenchman  William of Sens the most talented architect of his age.
nonapplause The president speaks of leaving no child behind  but leaves 2 million children behind to protect the tax cuts for the top one percent.
nonapplause You are given temporary custody of this great institution which was created by our Founding Fathers.
nonapplause I have to tell you  I looked that up in the dictionary.
nonapplause You miss your kids.
nonapplause I ask your support to rally around again  as North Carolina has on so many occasions  a Democratic Party which has produced men in this century like Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman  and more importantly has produced a party and popular support which has permitted them to move this country ahead.
nonapplause They may have successfully blocked us so far  but we're not going to give up.
nonapplause And there was no one there to pick him up.
nonapplause Even after an attack inside our own country  the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center  in New York  there was a tendency to treat terrorist incidents as individual criminal acts to be handled primarily through law enforcement.
nonapplause But because it is not without cost and risk  it is appropriate to have an open  full  national discussion before proceeding.
nonapplause Mr. Nixon has chosen in 1960 to run on a platform that our prestige and influence in the world has never been higher  and that we are enjoying here in the United States great prosperity.
nonapplause What you had to have was the equivalent of two years further training after high school.
nonapplause "It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.
nonapplause And they were good citizens.
nonapplause You see the enormous burden of paperwork squandering more and more hours of nurses and doctors  requiring more and more precious health care dollars to be diverted to clerical expenses instead of to investing in the health of our people.
nonapplause That is the way to increase political stability.
nonapplause If you look at the Medicare and the Medicaid issues  we have to slow the rate of growth in these entitlement programs.
nonapplause Then came September the 11th and then the horrible resumption of violence in the Middle East  which is the home of the world's three great monotheistic religions.
nonapplause They're the very essence of our democracy.
nonapplause These computer learning centers are the fruit of public/private partnership under the leadership of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
nonapplause And we needed change in America  and thanks to you we have had a chance over these last five years to put this agenda for change before the people.
nonapplause And it gives me great hope that the next hundred days and beyond will even have more speed on it.
nonapplause And is that all right with everybody?
nonapplause Patrick Henry  the famous orator of the Revolution  thought so.
nonapplause That kind of confidence I know invigorates the work you do here.
nonapplause So I implore you  when you go home  make your voices heard.
nonapplause We are the party of Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society.
nonapplause Our whole campaign in Alabama has been centered around the right to vote.
nonapplause We need it as individuals  we need to sense it in our fellow citizens  and we need it as a society and as a people."
nonapplause It is not just a matter of establishing Parliamentary institutions  the powers of government must be limited  the rule of law must be firmly established  and people need to become accustomed once more to exercising personal responsibility.
nonapplause I've come here so often in the last two years  I am reliably informed that if I appear again within the next six months  I will have to pay taxes.
nonapplause The valor of citizen soldiers and military and political leaders like Golda Meir  Moshe Dayan  Yonni Netanyahu.
nonapplause And I must say I was astonished by the performance of the Arizona Wildcats.
nonapplause We need a new strategy  and that's precisely what we've been developing.
nonapplause We couldn't have achieved the economic recovery we have if both Houses had remained in Democratic hands as they are now.
nonapplause Well  think about this.
nonapplause And this tax reduction will return as much as $30 billion a year to the American people to spend and to invest.
nonapplause And yet just in that short period of time  in our lifetimes  most of us  they have transformed the concentration of chlorine in the atmosphere.
nonapplause And I hope that as a group you will be in close touch with Ellen Lovell  who is running this project for the First Lady and for me  so that we can coordinate what we're doing.
nonapplause Of course  that was back when if somebody said  "Hey  kid " I answered.
nonapplause I'm going to be gone out here.
nonapplause I know you all are going to Capitol Hill today.
nonapplause He said  "I couldn't recognize him  but his driver was Gorbachev."
nonapplause And then we messed it all up in World War I and afterward.
nonapplause They've been hypin' junk.
nonapplause We see an America in which every day is Independence Day  the Fourth of July.
nonapplause For  what you decide will decide the issue--beginning  of course  with what you decide tonight.
nonapplause At the same time  we must make sure that when we say we're concerned about labor and the environment and human rights in the context of trade  it is not a pretext for protectionism.
nonapplause This good family works hard.
nonapplause As for his opponent  we only really began to learn about him during the last few months.
nonapplause And last but not least  he's the father of my national security adviser on Eastern Europe.
nonapplause Frank Sinatra  one of the few things I remember he ever said -- not what he sang -- he said  orange is the happiest color.
nonapplause We need not be more violent than other countries.
nonapplause This fall  I signed into law more than $30 billion in tax cuts for struggling businesses  extended an effective tax credit for homebuyers  and provided additional unemployment insurance for one million Americans.
nonapplause This is happening and it's happening every day.
nonapplause I know there's new businesses being started up all around the country.
nonapplause And I want to thank you all for coming.
nonapplause So I went to Washington with a simple  straightforward economic strategy  as I said  to create the conditions and give people the tools to succeed in the global economy that we have today and the one we're certainly going to have in the 21st century.
nonapplause I'll be speaking about another family here in a minute.
nonapplause That's a hard course.
nonapplause But I pledge to you today that I'll not rest -- and I know Jerry won't rest -- until every region of our country and every sector of our economy shares in the national prosperity.
nonapplause And I would just say just two or three things this morning.
nonapplause Will you ever have a private telephone conversation on a cell phone again?
nonapplause I'm not saying anything bad about them; they're good people.
nonapplause We're confident it's over 2 million jobs.
nonapplause I like to tell people that we had a Republican marriage.
nonapplause Leader  I know there's no -- we got an hour.” I said  “You set the vote for 7:00.
nonapplause So as somebody who's sort of coming back your way  to citizen activism  I thank you for coming here tonight  I thank you for your support for all your local candidates.
nonapplause What do those Americans do I saw them in West Virginia  over 100 000 families getting surplus food packages and no hope for the future.
nonapplause They see people merely as members of groups  special interests to be coddled and catered to.
nonapplause We are having such an extraordinary time  myself and my entire family  at this convention.
nonapplause It's my fervent hope that they will say we worked to break the patterns of history that all too often resulted in war  that we reached for accord  that we reached for peace.
nonapplause It was Immanuel Kant who said that it is often necessary to make a decision on the basis of knowledge sufficient for action but insufficient to satisfy the intellect.
nonapplause I see you with the big people.
nonapplause What they know is that when Jerry Ford left office in 1976  the prime rate was 6\1/4\ percent.
nonapplause The middle class has been struggling now for about a decade -- 10 years in which folks felt the sting of stagnant incomes and sluggish job growth and declining economic security  as well as at least eight years in which there was a profound animosity towards the notion of unions.
nonapplause We have also set aside $1 trillion over 10 years for contingencies.
nonapplause What we can't tolerate  what we can't accept as a nation  though  is the naysayers who want to wring their hands and say  well  it will never work.
nonapplause In addition  Mack will take on new responsibilities as Special Envoy to the President and the Secretary of State for Latin America.
nonapplause I say this because this is a political dinner  but most of us are here -- and we're Democrats instead of Republicans because we're motivated by these kinds of issues.
nonapplause Here at the Wright Brothers National Memorial  we remember one small machine  and we honor the giants who flew it.
nonapplause Everything we believe in  due process  representative government  it all rests on that principle.
nonapplause And so tonight  I say  America  if we don't have a prosperity deficit disorder  there's more with Gore  more health care with Gore  more education with Gore  more health with Gore  more wages with Gore  more freedom with Gore  more strength with Gore  more security with Gore  more prosperity with Gore  it's more and Gore.
nonapplause Already  thousands of AIDS  cancer and Alzheimer patients have found new hope  even new life  with these experimental therapies.
nonapplause That's the kind of future that we want for all of you.
nonapplause That shows how our trade can increase our prosperity and protect the environment as well.
nonapplause If this was the day after you elected him  a month after you elected him  even five months after you elected him  I could still think he's talking about a failure of his predecessor.
nonapplause I want each regulatory agency head to submit to the White House a list of pending procedures that can be converted into consensual negotiations.
nonapplause About half the people on welfare stay on for over two years  but one in four persons  the people that we really need to try to help to break the cycle that is gripping their children and grandchildren -- about one in four stays a recipient for eight years or longer.
nonapplause If we're conservatives and we do in fact believe all the things that I've been professing here  then how can we stand in the face of a government-dominated education system and believe that that government-dominated education system will continue to produce free people  citizens capable in fact of controlling their government?
nonapplause Thank you  everybody.
nonapplause Comparing both sides of the debate  we can see certain consequences for the world beyond the Middle East  consequences with direct implications for our own security.
nonapplause But had someone suggested a two-state solution  they would have been considered either demented or dreamers.
nonapplause Last year the science textbooks had to be re-written.
nonapplause No  I want you to know.
nonapplause Earlier this month I met at the White House with a group of leaders from the communities  from law enforcement  schools  business  government to talk about what can be done to keep all children safe.
nonapplause Or 21 years ago when a truck bomb hit a barracks in Beirut and killed 241 American Marines?
nonapplause If you support John Breaux  as I think you do  you will elect Mary Landrieu just to keep a smile on John's face.
nonapplause Europe had never produced anything like him  neither had anyplace else on Earth.
nonapplause And it's a vital relationship.
nonapplause But if you look at where we are now  bringing the deficit down has paid big dividends.
nonapplause I will oppose the effort to privatize it.
nonapplause All the shifts Senator Kerry has made are troubling  but there is one that really stands out.
nonapplause I disagree.
nonapplause But I've had more ordinary citizens come up to me personally all over this country and thank me for the Family and Medical Leave Law than any other thing that I've been involved with as President.
nonapplause The jokes may not be as good  but neither is the guest list.
nonapplause These are structural changes we have to make.
nonapplause Conservative Governments have never been laissez faire.—That label belonged to the Liberals.
nonapplause They're conservatively managed.
nonapplause We know these things; and hopefully one of the benefits of the wonderful education that you've received here at Notre Dame is that you've had time to consider these wrongs in the world; perhaps recognized impulses in yourself that you want to leave behind.
nonapplause All right?
nonapplause I know there are some in both political parties who view this increasing convergence with the rest of the world's economy as a cause for fear  as an excuse for retreat.
nonapplause And usually when a politician has to go do something that he or she would just as soon not do  that is unpopular at home and you just do it because you know it's the right thing to do  but you just hate it  you try to sit on the back row  hunch your shoulders and if at all photographed  you try to make sure your people see you looking as if you had just been sucking on a lemon.
nonapplause What can we do to make sure the American people understand how the troops in the field feel?
nonapplause At the same time  I accept without question the words of George Washington: "To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace."
nonapplause And he stopped because he was going by the general store in that strange town.
nonapplause We need to focus our efforts on economic growth and expanding opportunities for people.
nonapplause So I hope  as I leave  that we will be able to continue to build on this and return to the point where the environment is not a point of either partisan or geographic explosion  but a point of shared values and shared vision.
nonapplause Educated children grow up to be adults who have more opportunities to work  to support their own families  and to fully participate in the life of their country.
nonapplause I want to thank so many of you here for a lifetime of commitment.
nonapplause It would cripple our ability to pay down the debt.
nonapplause This is not about one country  and in this struggle there is no neutral ground.
nonapplause And that is very important.
nonapplause There was a great danger of even greater layoffs all across this state for vital services that would affect our kids and our families.
nonapplause We've come a long way.
nonapplause So today  you are all the heirs to that legacy.
nonapplause Let me tell you this: I want you to understand just how important this decision is for governors and Indiana.
nonapplause I'm trying to get some comfort from the story of a man who was going down the road one day with his son  leading a burro  and they met a man who said to them  “Don't you realize you shouldn't both be walking on this hot day?
nonapplause In the great doctrine of the Declaration  they set that down as the common ground of our citizenship  of our identity as a people--regardless whether we are Christian  or Muslim  or Jew  or whatever we are.
nonapplause Then he puts the burden on me to try to correct it.
nonapplause The people and the farmers of America are freemen  rather than peasant slaves.
nonapplause And guided by these ideals  I believe we can find a no-nonsense  workable  and lasting policy that will keep the peace.

nonapplause Iraq is the central battlefront in the war on terror.
nonapplause But to do it -- to do it -- we have to have an upsurge of personal responsibility from the private sector.
nonapplause But it all depends on what the American people decide today  in a moment of great good fortune  great national optimism  all the mean and stinging rhetoric we used to hear from the other side for 20 years -- life's gone away and butter wouldn't melt in their --   -- and I appreciate that.
nonapplause But our border is not yet secure  and there's more work to be done.
nonapplause Bobby Kennedy once said  "All great questions must be raised by great voices  and the greatest voice is the voice of the people -- speaking out -- in prose  or painting or poetry or music; speaking out -- in homes and halls  streets and farms  courts and cafes -- let that voice speak and the stillness you hear will be the gratitude of mankind."
nonapplause In 1950  there were about 16 workers for every retiree.
nonapplause And in the first 16 months of this administration  over three million new jobs in the private sector came into this economy -- two-and-a-half time as many than in the previous four years alone.

nonapplause My budget honors that pledge  and I'm now asking you  the Congress  to keep its end of the bargain.
nonapplause That's in our DNA.
nonapplause But none can soar at more than 500 miles an hour --   -- carrying freedom's message across oceans and continents.
nonapplause Those not yet captured are living in fear  and their fears are well founded.

nonapplause No sharper example can be found than the Democratic Party chairman himself  Howard Dean --
nonapplause And that's a competition that benefits Wall Street and Main Street.
nonapplause For decades  America remained a deeply religious country  thanking God in peacetime and turning to him in moments of crisis.
nonapplause There is a great deal of uncertainty out there  which makes people yearn for certainty  but also makes them vulnerable to the wrong kind of certainty; certainty that pits people against one anther instead of gives them a way to say  here are my problems  what are your problems  let's get together and figure out how to solve them.
nonapplause And now  with this report  we have a very solid road map that we need to make these goals real  to solve this problem within a generation.
nonapplause He said  you know what  this $20 billion fund is a “shakedown.” I think he called it a “Chicago-style shakedown.”   This is somebody who could be running our energy policy if the other party takes over.

nonapplause ﻿  Mrs. Bush's Remarks at Alpha Kappa Alpha National Convention
nonapplause He's very knowledgeable about Washington.
nonapplause And tell you  I believe we will win in the end because I have seen Congress time and time again go to the brink with the easy choice and make the hard one because they knew it was the right thing to do for America.
nonapplause Then for 12 years we heard the worst thing in the world is taxes; we'll just cut taxes  especially on wealthy people  and that will make everything wonderful.
nonapplause It's a public school with public funds set up outside the normal bureaucratic rules of a school system so that it can serve a specific population or have a special mission.

nonapplause This man is fitted to be President by experience  which came from his service in his home State of California's Legislature; in our Congress; and in the very high executive position as Vice President of our great Nation; by his leadership which he has displayed on so many  many occasions; by his temperament  which gives him this understanding of the feel of America; by his background of typical Americanism; by his very deep and abiding faith in the good life that has been provided in America under our principles and under our ideals.
nonapplause How are we going to embrace all this diversity we have and still be bound together as one America?
nonapplause A lot of them will say  no  no  that part's okay.
nonapplause And let's begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of Federal deficits.
nonapplause Now  in the past  the full weight of the Soviet-American relationship all too often seemed to rest on one issue: arms control  a plank not sturdy enough to bear up the whole platform of Soviet-American relations.
nonapplause I mean no offense to anybody  but I cringe a little bit.

nonapplause Abe Lincoln -- --
nonapplause France and Germany can be accused of minimising the dangers of disarming Iraq.

nonapplause And the leaders of the other party said that it would have no effect on the crime rate  that nothing good would happen  that we would never see these police on the street  that no guns would be kept out of the hands of criminals because criminals didn't buy guns in gun stores anyway.
nonapplause We cannot fully understand the designs and power of evil.
nonapplause The Bush doctrine asserts that states that support terror or provide sanctuary for terrorists and safe harbor will be deemed just as guilty of the crimes as the terrorists themselves.
nonapplause This is one of those problems that's in our hand.
nonapplause We now know that vaccines save lives and agony.
nonapplause All he has asked is that nobody votes against him because of his race.
nonapplause What we really need to do is to adopt a model that you have had to adopt back home -- get all kinds of people together  different people  different walks of life  different parties  different attitudes  different outlooks -- and bring everybody's strengths to the table and prove that we can create an era of possibility for everyone.
nonapplause And that literally will require rethinking everything about the way the government operates.
nonapplause The larger company  which does all the packaging work—the metal packaging work—which was put in  as you said  for the first time; the smaller company which Mr. Chapman started up on his own in the true British way and has become very successful; and the Lilliput Company which I think has won an award three times out of five.
nonapplause People say it has been irrelevant.
nonapplause And riding shotgun will be the big banks and the insurance companies and the oil companies and every special interest under the sun.
nonapplause The promise of democracy rests ultimately on free elections and the ability of free peoples to hold accountable those who govern them -- but that is only the beginning.
nonapplause We're ramping them up in a significant way.
nonapplause And somehow we've got to get that out to the American people.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The First Lady At The Washington Math And Science Tech Public CharterHigh School Graduation
nonapplause I don't know what the heck they're talking about.

nonapplause I feel very strongly that I ought to spend more time answering questions because I'm interested in what you want to talk about.
nonapplause In the next 10 years we are going to have to find 25 000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years.

nonapplause How well we know that.
nonapplause I can't tell you how honored I am that so many of you would come out here to say hello.
nonapplause And so I decided to break the taboo; I decided to say the words: how about this?
nonapplause It would last no more than 3 years  and it would start only if the Congress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program.
nonapplause In a sense  it was the planting season and it was time to get these programs out  up and running  and be on the backs of governors and mayors to make sure that they have let the contracts and that they had an accounting procedure in place where they'd be able to let us know exactly what happened.
nonapplause I just remember one time sitting with the Queen of England at a formal dinner  and he recited the entire -- the entire lineage of the Tudors and every year each one had served.

nonapplause The attacks of September 11th  2001  signaled the arrival of an entirely different era.

nonapplause All I can say is that we've got the best minds working on it and
nonapplause They voted against $500 billion in deficit reduction; tax cuts for almost 17 percent of the working families in this country who hover at the poverty line and who are raising their children so that we could lift them beyond the poverty line and take away any incentive they would have to go on welfare and quit work; tax cuts for 90 percent of the small businesses in this country; increased capital gains for investment in new business and small business; a reform of the college loan system which cut the interest rates and strung out the repayment terms.
nonapplause But this isn't just about where jobs are today; this is where American jobs will be tomorrow.
nonapplause We heard from President Yushchenko of Ukraine and from President Obasanjo of Nigeria on the need for genuine democratic revolution to make sure that states deliver for their own people  and on their uphill battles to uproot the tangled web of decades of corruption.
nonapplause And  of course  on July 7th when Britain also experienced that hostility  I hope that Britain felt the support of the United States in our joint desire to defeat those forces that are so hostile to our democratic principles.
nonapplause She's passionate for fighting for California's families and making sure that everybody here has got a fair shake; that if they're willing to work hard  that they can reach for that American Dream.
nonapplause And I think that it is no mean feat that we continue to work at in this country.
nonapplause I am not satisfied to see people in Latin America  Africa  and Asia  who used to look to President Roosevelt  Woodrow Wilson  and Truman  now wonder what has happened to us  why we are on the decline  and look to Khrushchev and Peiping.
nonapplause Do you feel our position in Latin America is stronger than a decade ago  or that the balance of power in Africa is moving with us  or that we are meeting the problems of people all around the globe in expressing ourselves with vigor?

nonapplause They said  well  we'll tell you that after the election.
nonapplause That's the deal here.
nonapplause Over partisanship and prejudice we can still come together.

nonapplause You know  in those unusual gifts  I have to tell you  someone gave me one the other day -- it was new to me.
nonapplause These things did not just happen.
nonapplause I'm proud of the fact that we changed the economic philosophy that dominated Washington for a long time; that we reversed trickle-down economics and instead said we're going to reduce the deficit and invest in our future  we're going to expand trade and make it more fair.
nonapplause In some ways  it's a remarkable situation.
nonapplause — We have seen what may be the greatest international coalition in history take shape: the uniting of many nations  races and faiths against Saddam Hussein and his brutal invasion and plunder of Kuwait.
nonapplause And you can help get it done today.

nonapplause To remove this danger to civilization we have to proceed on many fronts at the same time -- from law enforcement  to diplomacy  to a global effort against weapons of mass destruction.
nonapplause For generations  the American Dream has represented a fundamental compact among our people.
nonapplause Why?

nonapplause A crowd had gathered around; a woman was bending over  administering to him.
nonapplause But what we showed here one year ago today is that we could do something different.
nonapplause The worst part of this epidemic is that it isn't the product of deadly natural forces raging out of control  but a sophisticated  deliberate marketing campaign targeted at our children.
nonapplause The greatest threat to our democracy today  and certainly to freedom and democracy around the world  is the poisonous idea that what divides us is far more important than what we have in common; that as long as we have differences of opinion we must have personal animosities and we cannot have positive action.
nonapplause Because we've gone on the offense  America is safer  but we are not yet safe  as we've seen just recently with the foiled terror plot in London.

nonapplause This spells penury for Britain and trade union leaders know it as well as anyone.

nonapplause This is a period in history defined by serious challenges  and by the need for decisive action.
nonapplause But we will  all of us  for the rest of our lives be fighting and working to make sure that our nation is not put at risk and that our world can become safer by making sure the forces of order win over the forces of chaos  and that the people who wish to have freedom are also willing to exercise it with responsibility.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by The President on Energy Efficiency and Job Creation
nonapplause To remain competitive  we need to keep the economy growing -- and growth is more likely when Americans have more of their own money to spend  to save  and to invest.

nonapplause And as he looked out over the crowd in Independence  Missouri  that day  he said  “History shapes men  but it is a necessary faith of leadership that men can shape history.”
nonapplause Abroad  as at home  we must measure the success of our efforts by one simple standard: Have we made the lives of the American people safer; have we made the future for our children more secure.

nonapplause I'm proud to be introduced by my friend.
nonapplause And I have a feeling that many people who could take advantage of flex time would spend that time making a difference in their communities.

nonapplause He jumped right into this job and he didn't miss a step  didn't miss a beat  and was ready to go from day one.
nonapplause I want to applaud the Metropolitan Museum of Art for all the outreach that you do  for having kids like these here today to be involved in this and to experience this and to share this with us  because this is your place  too.
nonapplause The same liberal philosophy that saw an era of prosperity and virtue ushered in by changing man's environment through massive Federal spending programs also viewed criminals as the unfortunate products of poor socioeconomic conditions or an underprivileged upbringing.
nonapplause History is made when a leader's passion is matched with his principle in service of his country.
nonapplause I understand my friend  Dick Grasso  and the Barnes and Noble CEO  Leonard Riggio  are both from that region of Italy.
nonapplause It need not be a weakness; it can be an enormous asset for us as we move into a global society.

nonapplause In the jobs program I presented to Congress  one of the things we had was enough money to hire a lot more border patrol people.
nonapplause The pundits in Washington -- I have befuddled them over the last 20 months.
nonapplause What really matters is not so much what we've had but what we intend to do with what we have.
nonapplause Because the overwhelming majority of sportsmen in this country -- sportsmen and women -- are honest  good  law-abiding people  and we need everybody working together to whip this problem of crime and violence.
nonapplause They made us all believe that  yes  we can  together  make a difference.
nonapplause You know  my opponent's view of the mess in 1980 is not quite the same as yours and mine.
nonapplause And the other little explanation -- if it's been overlooked -- that I want you to know  too  is that I made it very plain that we are ready to sign now a treaty that is binding as law that would say when we have rid ourselves of those ballistic missiles on both sides and if SDI has proven out to be the shield  the defensive shield we think it can be  we will be very happy to turn it over  also  and let the Soviet Union have it so that both of us can go on through history without being suspicious of each other.
nonapplause That ordinarily is thought of as beginning in 1946.
nonapplause But back in Washington  the liberals already are saying they want to raise taxes  and they have all kinds of inflationary spending programs in the works.
nonapplause The day I took office  the deficit was projected to be about $300 billion for that year.
nonapplause They said the program would push interest rates to a new record.
nonapplause This trade authority will give me the leverage to negotiate agreements that do exactly that.
nonapplause It simply gives all free people the chance to find the answers that work for them.
nonapplause Secondly  I think this principle is very important.
nonapplause It's never been as important an opportunity for America as it is right now.
nonapplause And so that's one of the reasons we were a little bit slow getting here.
nonapplause My home is in Cleveland.
nonapplause You're laughing 'cause you know what that means.
nonapplause Several years ago  Nancy left a fast-paced marketing agency in Chicago to be a full-time mom.
nonapplause And even if there are unfortunate consequences  we are philosophically opposed to doing anything that would interfere with that.

nonapplause ﻿  Vice President's Remarks at the Republican National Convention with An Introduction by Mrs. Cheney
nonapplause It's pretty clear the President's tax relief has done exactly what it was designed to do: to add momentum to America's economy and to help more people find jobs.
nonapplause It doesn't come from outer space.
nonapplause We don't have a 21\1/2\-percent prime rate of interest anymore.
nonapplause We've seen it with the Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda.
nonapplause His miscalculation was going to war without planning carefully and without the allies that we should have had at our side.
nonapplause It is an important part of making sure we have a hopeful future.
nonapplause In Afghanistan  the Taliban regime brutalized an entire population and harbored al Qaeda -- and that regime is no more.
nonapplause When President Bush and I took the oath of office on the inaugural platform on the west front of the Capitol  our economy was sliding into recession.
nonapplause We set a goal of funding 135 000 education jobs -- because I heard from every governor  every mayor  every county executive  about the fear of closing down schools  increasing class sizes  laying off tens of thousands of teachers.
nonapplause Born to a military family  achieving an exceptional military career  but he made peace his calling.
nonapplause The machine was a size of a refrigerator and had the computing power of today's hand-held calculators.
nonapplause And when we have evidence of credible threats  we will issue appropriate alerts.
nonapplause Today  it is with great pride that I stand here with many of our law enforcement officers who  every day  are prepared to make the same sacrifice.
nonapplause Economists have weighed in on this subject  calling people who fight others or take advantage of them for short term benefit without regard to their long term consequences “rational fools.” Psychologists and psychiatrists have written books about the impulse to cooperate and the impulse to fight.
nonapplause We said we would take this country in a new direction.
nonapplause And as we do  we will also be seeking to improve relations between the Israelis and Palestinians.
nonapplause The military is seen by many as an avenue for advancement  a job where individual merit will be recognized and rewarded.
nonapplause and Harry Truman has become the party of McGovern and Carter and Mondale and Dukakis.

nonapplause The Yankee took one swig  and it did calm him right down.
nonapplause VAT limits are up.
nonapplause Now  at the end of this last congressional session  what did they do?
nonapplause And we're going to keep this nation strong to protect freedom and peace for us  for our children  and for our children's children.
nonapplause If you like your plan  you can keep your plan.
nonapplause That's what I really believe.
nonapplause And what happened?
nonapplause People keep telling me that Senator Edwards got picked for his good looks  his charm  because he's sexy and has great hair.
nonapplause The fact of the matter is  George Tenet  who was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency two years ago  in October of '02  went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in open  public session and testified that there had  in fact  been a roughly 10-year relationship between al Qaeda and the Iraqi government.
nonapplause This is a subject which will be high on the agenda for my discussions with Mr. Gorbachev in London next week.
nonapplause But we can make the tax plan  this fair tax plan  a reality.
nonapplause Not raised on a pedestal  but available  touchable  for people who are in wheelchairs and people who cannot see.
nonapplause And if we can keep government under control  we can do it by enacting a line-item veto and a constitutional amendment mandating that the Government stop spending more than the Government takes in.
nonapplause And we cannot do it by just government programs alone  because we still have to -- I'll say more about that in a minute  but we've got to find a way to bring enterprise to these people.
nonapplause Ending our dependence on foreign oil  reforming our immigration system  rebuilding the Gulf Coast  and keeping our country safe from terrorism are not easy tasks  but they are absolutely vital goals.
nonapplause And Mike said  "Bring me liniment and I'll have that bird flying again in 15 minutes."
nonapplause And I am pleased to announce today emergency grants from other government agencies.
nonapplause Now  no big deal.
nonapplause And there will always be a lag between what the world needs and what the political systems of various nations will provide.
nonapplause We have begun to solve those problems.
nonapplause For the last few years  I've talked about these issues with Americans from one end of this country to another.
nonapplause Thank you all for being here.
nonapplause Is this the way it's supposed to be?
nonapplause Many people don't feel that the years that they've put in -- sometimes are not appreciated.
nonapplause It's time for some people to realize the party is over.
nonapplause He stood up on a pile of rubble with a bullhorn in his hand.
nonapplause In few places can you see more clearly the collapse of the liberal stranglehold on our courts.
nonapplause It's debt.

nonapplause Today  we gather in Miami to mark a quiet revolution and to launch a new era  for here in the Americas  as all of us know  nation after nation has freed itself from dictatorship and debt  and embraced democracy and development.
nonapplause And I think that's very important.
nonapplause This nation wants to move forward.
nonapplause The bottom line is this.
nonapplause Wearing uniforms instead of gang colors in many places is helping to keep our children safe.
nonapplause Enough to halve the value of our pound notes—again—in ten years.
nonapplause And hello to your Executive Director Tom Cochran  who does a great job for you day in and day out here with us.
nonapplause The number of people on the Web has been doubling every eight months.
nonapplause They know the problems of their own communities  and above all  they recognize the dignity of every citizen and the possibilities of every life.
nonapplause Louder.
nonapplause This was back in 1956.
nonapplause That means that instead of a rule of law  in which you shall try to discern a line between right and wrong and construct a society based upon the observance in different actions and situations of that line  you will have a society in which outcomes are determined by the interplay of forces.
nonapplause Small businesses in America are paying 30 percent more on average than big business and government  and more and more people are going without health care coverage.
nonapplause They no longer know who to blame when things go wrong.
nonapplause I'd also like to thank the Speaker of the House  the Senate Majority Leader  and the House and Senate Democratic leaders for nominating and being represented here today by the members of Congress who are on the program.
nonapplause Indeed  you can make a compelling case that the recession we have endured in jobs is almost totally tied to the fact that the small business engine that created more jobs than big business lost in the 1980s came to a screeching halt in the last two years in the face of a recession  a credit crunch  the incredible burden of health care costs and other costs on small business in adding new employees to their enterprises.
nonapplause Free nations listen to the hopes and aspirations of their people.
nonapplause They pledged to repeal Wall Street reform.
nonapplause Well  thank you all.
nonapplause Okay  I'm willing.

nonapplause I want to thank the Mayor for coming and Congressman Clement and Gordon and Tanner.
nonapplause Is that what that phrase says?
nonapplause Real family income is up  inflation last year at the lowest level in over 20 years  a greater percentage of our work force employed than ever before in our national history  and yes  the creation of more than 13 million new jobs.
nonapplause Should that or should that not be a priority?
nonapplause If you want people to organize themselves well  run themselves well and build a future  we've got to do this.
nonapplause The thugs and assassins in Iraq are desperately trying to shake our will.
nonapplause It's why we're able to reform a death penalty system that was broken.

nonapplause Dr. King  his family  and those who join in his cause set in motion changes that will forever reverberate across America  across the lines of geography  class and race.
nonapplause And it requires the coura!
nonapplause Many of them have been displaced by changes in the way things are produced.
nonapplause I waited until after the tour when he said he was going to be there taking questions  and I went to him and I said  "Now  are you instructed in what you say  or do you say  sort of  your own things?"
nonapplause "Do not be overcome by evil  but overcome evil with good."
nonapplause And they want us to do it without a corresponding reduction from the Soviet Union.
nonapplause Can we demonstrate over a long period of time that our system represents the best means of organizing human society?
nonapplause We're looking forward to the months ahead.
nonapplause I want you to have those incentives; I just want poor areas in America to be as attractive.
nonapplause This is Mr. Nixon's record  and I think it is a record that we should consider in the next 4 weeks.
nonapplause Their tax increase is a giant stop sign that would bring our entire economy and your opportunities for the future screeching to a halt.
nonapplause Now if you buy an American car  it may be an American car built with some parts from Taiwan  designed by Germans  sold with British-made advertisements  or a combination of others in a different mix.
nonapplause The President also recognized and made the decision that there's no such thing as the perfect defense  that given the nature of the threat that if you're successful 999 times out of 1 000  that one remaining time that they get through could kill you.
nonapplause And there was some truth in that.
nonapplause Now  again  I want to thank Dick for his role in helping us to move closer to our dreams  and I want to thank all of you here today  as well.
nonapplause When you see those commercials  or hear them  about me and the deficit  may I just tell you that every year the law requires I send a budget to the Congress.
nonapplause Soon the only solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call "fortified hamlets."
nonapplause He has made clear from the outset  both publicly and privately  that our duty to uphold the law of the land admits no exceptions in wartime.
nonapplause When Veronica told me of her story  it was through the kind of tears no young woman should ever know.
nonapplause By the way  finally got cops on railroads now.
nonapplause Billy Munger in Mississippi and Dr. Moye there and of course Hank McAmish and others in Atlanta.
nonapplause In any productive life you're going to find a lot of hard work  and belief in that work.
nonapplause And let me thank everyone who participated in the program this morning and for those putting on this program.
nonapplause That's fine.
nonapplause So among other things  we think coal ought to continue to be a very important part of the mix.
nonapplause And the road to a new  clean energy economy is even longer.
nonapplause This is a community of character  as far as I'm concerned.
nonapplause Before the Recovery Act  we could build just 5 percent of the world's solar panels.
nonapplause Mr. President  nothing has more distinguished and dignified our age than the struggle for human rights and freedom in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
nonapplause We had a remarkable health care forum last night  as you probably know  in Tampa  with about 1 000 people there.
nonapplause I got into this work because that's what I wanted to do.
nonapplause They articulated their vision of America's heart and compassion!
nonapplause The job growth of the past four months is expected to continue.
nonapplause And lasting opportunities for the middle class in areas like clean energy  the smart grid  high-speed rail  and high-technology changes will take place.
nonapplause You'll never hold a free election in Afghanistan.
nonapplause Let me just say one other thing.
nonapplause Right?

nonapplause I have met both in the region and here in NY and in Europe with affected government officials NGOs  UN agencies  corporate leaders and ordinary citizens who care about these issues.
nonapplause If $3 000 kept one person out of the penitentiary  it saved $30 000 a year.
nonapplause We've confronted dictatorships that defied the demands of the civilized world.
nonapplause So the European question is  how do you get growth manifested in jobs and not give up your social solidarity.
nonapplause We all of us have a stake in peace in the Middle East.
nonapplause We should protect them.
nonapplause And why do we have deficits?
nonapplause Too many families are still not where they need to be  but our progress has made them more financially secure  they have more opportunities  and I happen to believe this is what fairness is all about.
nonapplause On Christmas Eve I had the honor of calling some of our troops who are around the world  service members  men and women from many bases  including Ft.
nonapplause When I spoke to you last year  I reported that the U.S. economy had had 53 consecutive months of growth.
nonapplause A year and a half ago  our economy was shrinking at 6 percent a year; now it's growing.
nonapplause But with so many young people here today  I have a special message for you from my roommate.
nonapplause We all need one of those.
nonapplause It remade a government of the people and for the people.
nonapplause It's times like these  when diplomacy is being conducted at the highest level  that I'm particularly grateful for the way that we  as a free people  pull together.
nonapplause Through war and peace  from recession to expansion  our nation has fulfilled its obligation to older Americans.
nonapplause These are folks in the classroom right now because we refused to accept a lesser education for our children  even at a time of economic hardship.
nonapplause And of course  at the heart of that effort is to do everything we can to improve our defenses here at home  so we spent a lot of time and effort creating the Department of Homeland Security  the biggest reorganization of the federal government since the Department of Defense was established back in 1947 -- took 22 different agencies  170 000 people and put them together in a new department with a specific mission of hardening the target  so to speak  of making the United States a more difficult target for the terrorists to come after.
nonapplause More than 100 years ago  Gary's grandfather left China on a steamship bound for America  and found work as a domestic servant in Washington State.
nonapplause We have a minority home ownership gap in America  and I have submitted plans to the United States Congress to close that gap.

nonapplause The desire for liberty is a universal value.
nonapplause We agreed to forge a new partnership between our nations aimed at restoring world economic growth  advancing democratic values  and creating the basis for regional peace which can endure well into the next century.
nonapplause Now  of course  this economic expansion has plenty of economists puzzled.
nonapplause And say how they're going to pay for it.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause I especially want to thank my old friends John Rowland and Frank Keating.
nonapplause I just want to point out we've heard such arguments before.
nonapplause These guerrillas use violence to support their threats.
nonapplause Now  this program will do three things.
nonapplause Tomorrow  the first flight will leave  bound for Afghanistan to deliver packages.
nonapplause My friends  there's also another point that ought to be made.
nonapplause He's a person that clearly speaks with conviction.
nonapplause We're proud of that record but we just do not stand on it because a record is not something to stand on.
nonapplause And  of course  there's an individual whose very name causes liberals to break out in a nervous rash --   -- a friend of mine and a champion of our cause  Senator Jesse Helms.
nonapplause We're increasing trade missions.
nonapplause I read in the Washington Post about a young woman named Victoria.
nonapplause There were only eight of them left alive -- all wounded.
nonapplause And I doubt there was a delicious plate of baked ziti waiting for him  either.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause Did you see it?
nonapplause There's 250 000 people with criminal records or mental health histories who couldn't buy handguns because we passed the Brady Bill -- and we don't know how many people are alive because of that  and they're out telling stories tonight of their lives because we did that.
nonapplause This will emphasize foreign language training and equipment internship in international manufacturing companies.
nonapplause We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom.
nonapplause You know how that first tax cut's being paid for?
nonapplause I come here tonight not on a botanical expedition  not to catch fish and butterflies  but I come to the home of this party with Lyndon Johnson and ask for your help.
nonapplause One of the great byproducts of what we did in Afghanistan and Iraq is what happened to Libya.
nonapplause This isn't surprising when you consider their record.
nonapplause And our strategy has to be in terms of conducting this global war on terror and ultimately prevailing  has to be that we fundamentally change circumstances on the ground in a place like Afghanistan and Iraq so that we  in effect  drain the swamp so to speak  so that we don't have  or leave behind breeding grounds for dictatorial regimes like Saddam Hussein's  or the Taliban  or states that become safe havens and sanctuaries for terror.
nonapplause Well  we see an America in which every day is Independence Day  the Fourth of July.
nonapplause Now  you and I would recognize  wouldn't we  that the judges don't have that right.
nonapplause We understand the key to victory is to do the work we've been given  and to do it well.
nonapplause This is providing a vast new pool of capital for investment and is a tangible indicator that interest rates should be coming down soon.
nonapplause I've proposed merit schools and magnet schools to reward and encourage excellence in education.
nonapplause We're going to have to deal with the issue of climate change in a responsible way.
nonapplause Throughout human history people have always found self-definition by positive reference to their crowd and negative reference to the other.
nonapplause And he gave all that up to join us here in Washington where we're having so much fun in the public sector.
nonapplause All of us should be able to keep as much of the fruits of our labor as possible.
nonapplause I guess that's the difference when you're President -- they let you come inside.
nonapplause That is rebuilding the economy to give a tip to those who've enjoyed the most doesn't rebuild it.
nonapplause It's people like you who show us the heart of America is good  the spirit of America is strong  and the future of America is great.
nonapplause If we're going to rebuild the American community  we have to have more rights and responsibility.
nonapplause She is an esteemed writer and thinker who will serve our country well.
nonapplause The average monthly welfare benefit in America is actually lower today  adjusted for inflation  than it was 20 years ago.
nonapplause Open markets will accelerate the information revolution in China  giving more people more access to more sources of knowledge.
nonapplause To gather at this time of reflection is to feel once again the impact of April 19th  and to admire once again the resolve that came through almost immediately in Oklahoma City.
nonapplause That's why we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.
nonapplause The bill passed 99-0 in the Senate  and I will sign the Senate bill if the House and the Senate will send it to me.
nonapplause And this cannot rightly be called a full Progressive Era until we have addressed these challenges.
nonapplause You know  we do this in all kinds of other ways.
nonapplause I don't think Labour should be allowed to splutter on into the dying days of this Parliament.
nonapplause What's our program?
nonapplause It's about how we get along with each other  what we know about each other.
nonapplause Many of us can remember our teachers in stunning detail -- their faces  their expressions  their voices  their favorite admonitions.
nonapplause We also had pretended to be deeply religious and there were no blacks in my school  they were in a segregated school.
nonapplause And now  thank God  he has fully recovered and runs and plays and torments his older sisters like any little boy.
nonapplause But what was true was that unlike many of my classmates at that wonderful institution whose families had attended Princeton for generations  my parents hadn't gone to college  so they couldn't really tell me what to expect or how to prepare.
nonapplause The stakes in this campaign are high  not just for the political parties  but for the country  and that's what brings us all together today.
nonapplause That's what he said on September 30th.
nonapplause Technology will be critical to our progress going forward.
nonapplause They don't need us to be perfect.
nonapplause There's a lot of interest in Congress on the subject and out around the country  as there should be.
nonapplause For decades labor has been telling the nation about the dangers of unchecked corporate power.
nonapplause Well Charlie  thank you very much.
nonapplause I appreciate his strong sense of advocacy for ordinary Americans.
nonapplause So this is an entrepreneurial  under-funded  under-organized  economic opportunity.
nonapplause It is our bounden duty to conserve the systems which support that life and try to correct the damage that has been done to our environment while there is still time.
nonapplause Despite the recession we inherited and despite 9/11 and the corporate scandals  this economy is growing.
nonapplause Both houses have taken historic action.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause One day I-- I remember back in 2001  when I got my Foundation started.
nonapplause We're exporting more than ever before in our history.
nonapplause And I believe  in these election years--like the one we will face on Tuesday--the crisis of this hope is coming to a head.
nonapplause This afternoon  I would like to talk to you about the new economy and the limited but critical role that I think government has to play in the 21st Century.
nonapplause He kept telling them uncomfortable truths.
nonapplause We are confident that it will be reversed on appeal.
nonapplause In Iraq  the air tasking order was immediately available to all participating air commands -- Army  Navy  Air Force and Marines -- on the military Internet.
nonapplause And that's what brings us here today from Norfolk  going backwards to Columbus  Ohio  to Sioux City  Iowa  to Aurora  Colorado  where we began this journey a few days ago.
nonapplause He had come back up and caught up just in time to turn the band to the right down an intersection.
nonapplause So if he hadn't been there to vote for it  or if he has said  you know  I come from Louisiana  it's a conservative state  and he'd taken a dive  none of us would be here tonight  because I wouldn't have been reelected  the economy wouldn't be in good shape and we'd all be singing another tune.
nonapplause For some  it is a joy  a chance to share memories over a cup of coffee  a chance to share the rhythm and cycles of life.
nonapplause I have been more blessed than any American in my lifetime.
nonapplause Congress has passed important new legislation giving us modern methods to pursue the war on terror  while safeguarding the rights of law-abiding citizens.
nonapplause But we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek -- a world where extremists no longer threaten our people  and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own  and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens  and the rights of all God's children are respected.
nonapplause Now  all of this I go through  complicated as it may seem sometimes  because the root of it  as we saw  was what?
nonapplause It's about more even than the success of your businesses  more than the profits that you might earn  more than the jobs you might have.
nonapplause As the State of the Cities Report shows  cities still face critical opportunity gaps when it comes to jobs  to education  and to housing.
nonapplause That you couldn't be tough on crime where it was appropriate and still be smart and compassionate where it made sense and where it was the right thing to do.
nonapplause What did the Republicans ever do for South Carolina?
nonapplause Minimum wage - Mr. Nixon's Republican Party voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties  and they voted 90 percent against the $1.25 in 1960.
nonapplause So they made me the President of the Senate.
nonapplause Among his heroes  President Clinton always includes his mother  Virginia Kelley  "a working woman and a widow."
nonapplause Because human life is a gift from our Creator and should never be used as a means to an end  we will not sanction the creation of life only to destroy it.
nonapplause Unless they finish high school  unless they have a chance to go to college  if they have the talent to go to college  if they have the ability and motivation  how are they going to pay for their way through life; how are they going to meet their responsibilities?
nonapplause After looking at the returns and speaking with my family and my campaign team  I have decided tonight to end my quest for the presidency of the United States of America.
nonapplause Nearly 70 percent of them are adults.
nonapplause I worked in Haiti  Northern Ireland  Bosnia  Kosovo  Ethiopia  Eritrea  Burundi  East Timor  and many other places besides the Middle East.
nonapplause But the problems of the Third World are not only those of famine.
nonapplause And I must say this: You're not only welcome  but if you are here  I think you're here because -- like happened to me once -- you no longer can follow the policies of the leadership of your party.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause Every good coach I know  and I've been privileged to know quite a few great ones  always say that the players make great coaches.
nonapplause But we lose then the enormous resource we have right now of time to get in place a program that over time for that younger generation who are going to be out there in the work force for the next 30 or 40 years to accrue real value in a personal retirement account that will help offset the fact that we haven't fully funded the promises that have been made up until now with respect to Social Security.
nonapplause It'll help invigorate the economy.
nonapplause True believers  those who profess belief  they are going to decide the future of this country.
nonapplause It didn't happen because the taxes didn't bring in as much money as they thought.

nonapplause But this administration and the entire weight of state and local government can't do it alone either.
nonapplause We tried to pass a bill for medical care for the aged tied to social security.
nonapplause John Gibson.

nonapplause And all across Capitol Hill  your congressman is regarded as a smart  independent  and effective public servant.
nonapplause Is that the kind of country any self-respecting American wants to live in?
nonapplause Ted Stevens understands that.
nonapplause I'm just saying.
nonapplause And  by the way  it's important to note here that the recognition of this deep and ongoing involvement of Iran and Libya in international terrorism is hardly confined to our own government.
nonapplause I'd like to mention just two  for example.
nonapplause It hasn't happened  because the local authorities know we mean business.
nonapplause And  also  Americans in this century I think have had  and will continue to have  the greatest dedication to peace of any people in the world.
nonapplause Does anybody think we can sustain our position in the world without a radically altered education system  where we're no longer 17th in the world in the number of college graduates we graduate?

nonapplause Elect Bob Carr and Dale Kildee and Jim Barcia and Bob Mitchell and Howard Wolpe and Debbie Sabenow.
nonapplause That is what I hope we will have here today.
nonapplause I think one of the reasons that the Nurses Association has been so forthright about this health care reform issue is that you see it from the grass roots up in human terms  and you don't get so hung up as some people do on all the political rhetoric and the positioning and the characterizations that have  frankly  put a lot of members of Congress at a severe disadvantage because they haven't had the chance to spend the time and make the effort to deal with this issue that you have.
nonapplause And so today I want to challenge you to use your love and knowledge of science to spark the same sense of wonder and excitement in a new generation.
nonapplause I agree that Congress has a role to play.
nonapplause And Bill and Grace and their children have spent the night in the White House.

nonapplause As one scholar  John McKnight  put it: "I know from years in the neighborhoods that we can rely on community creativity .
nonapplause They don't get to buy food or drive cars or exchange money  but that's pretty low cost per job creation.
nonapplause And I discovered  for example  in the city of Philadelphia the average school building is 65 years old.
nonapplause What we have now  however  is the result of decisions taken by a president and an administration for whom the best law is no law  so long as law threatens to constrain their political will.
nonapplause We can learn a lot from remembering what we saw here  and yet they gave me a chance to prove that I could be a part of a larger community of peace-loving people.
nonapplause My husband is so committed to education because he looks at schools the way parents would look at schools.
nonapplause Or their plan  which is a big  old scheme  sounds great at a election time: a bigger deficit  higher interest rates  bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed when they shut the government down.
nonapplause We need to let people have more of their own money so that they can decide what to do with it."
nonapplause -- To get a letter from an enlisted man on a submarine that says he knows he's speaking for his 180 shipmates  and he wound up saying  "We may not have the biggest navy in the world anymore; we've got the best."
nonapplause Yes  the Congress is the only one in government that can spend a dime; the President can't spend a thing.

nonapplause In two-and-a-half years  we have come far  we've done a lot  we've taken on a lot of problems.
nonapplause We shouldn't have two tax systems  one for the special interests  the big corporations  many of whom pay no taxes at all  and one for all of those families who just work hard every year and pay their taxes and carry the tax burden in America.
nonapplause And we know that many of those who founded our nation more than 200 years ago were themselves very young.
nonapplause Some have suggested that by liberating Iraq from Saddam Hussein  we simply stirred up a hornet's nest.
nonapplause Apparently  and this is why I believe you have to speak out  because there are people with good hearts.
nonapplause Africa is the central battleground of this new world between the forces of integration and those of disintegration.
nonapplause And I appreciate your helping getting us to this point.
nonapplause Thank all of you.
nonapplause And we've got to resolve the differences now in the House and the Senate bill and pass it.
nonapplause I also believe very strongly that we should pass a national patients' bill of rights  like the one Governor Shaheen has been trying to pass here.
nonapplause A few months ago I went out on a limb with a prediction that we'd see interest rates drop again before the end of the warm weather.
nonapplause In fact  that approach has had a negative impact.

nonapplause They're looking for a way to turn their frustration  excitement  anxiety into action.
nonapplause It is the best -- it shows what can -- it is the best of Washington  when people decide to cooperate  not bicker  when people put the national interests ahead of political interests.

nonapplause Not every community is as blessed as Eglin is.
nonapplause So the President has developed  I think  a successful strategy.
nonapplause Nor is it only at the Scottish Office that they make their presence felt and the voice of Scotland heard.
nonapplause Well  some of the comments were made so loudly that I couldn't quite hear what was said.
nonapplause But it is the best of times because we have a chance to strike a blow  not only for our own security but for the freedom of those who look to us for assistance and succor  who look to us for an example of what freedom can do.
nonapplause And if you put them in they'll spend us in the ditch  and tax us until we bleed.

nonapplause Just recently I was proud to nominate Everett Alvarez to be Deputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration.

nonapplause It's no accident that when they want to have elections in South Africa  they ask us to come help put them on.

nonapplause The housing market still has a long way to go.
nonapplause My Press Secretary wants something that will prevent leaks.
nonapplause It's time Congress cut the Federal budget and left the family budget alone.
nonapplause I am pleased that just last month  the U.S. and Georgia launched a Charter on Strategic Partnership.
nonapplause But the record is testimony not to good luck  but to urgent  competent action by a lot of very skilled men and women -- and to a series of tough decisions by a President who never forgets that his first job is to protect the people of this country.
nonapplause The Sun must have been shining."
nonapplause We refuse to let repression cloak itself in moral relativism.
nonapplause And we were beginning to lose  perhaps  that wonderful do-it-yourself thing that that has always characterized the American people.

nonapplause This is a time for a more personal comment.

nonapplause And when the terrible government shutdown occurred and people lost some of those services.
nonapplause Every great society is going to face  for the foreseeable future  these incredible tensions between our freedom and our abuse of our freedom; between the need for liberty and the need for order; between our desire to have an entrepreneurial  freeflowing society and the absolute need for some discipline that enables us to live as human beings civilly together and give our children a chance to grow up.
nonapplause And we had a glimpse of the even greater harm they wish to do to us.
nonapplause Then the Russians justified what they were doing because of what happened to them and their need to control everybody around them.

nonapplause And when Israel needed leadership  they summoned him to serve democracy and he distinguished himself in the halls of government.

nonapplause There are some people on Wall Street and in banks across America that do right by their customers.
nonapplause In 1996 and again in 1998  Osama bin Laden declared war against the United States.

nonapplause Our partnership for freedom and democracy and for prosperity  and our partnership against drugs  organized crime  environmental decay  and social injustice is fundamental to the future of the American people and to the future of the Mexican people.
nonapplause We resisted the temptation to be the better Santa Claus  and instead offered people the only truth  which is the hope based upon a clear commitment to our nation's principles  to the courage  the character  the decency to sustain those principles  not just in our laws  but in our hearts.
nonapplause And I want to thank Congressman Peter Deutsch and his wife Lori for being good friends to me and great supporters over these last several years.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a White House Reception for the Kennedy Center Honorees
nonapplause That's so sweet of you all -- please.
nonapplause Don't forget  there's a heart of darkness that potentially lurks within us all.
nonapplause Well  we're enjoying the strongest economic expansion in 30 years.
nonapplause No one could have a better  more devoted partner.
nonapplause But after two years  mercy  they looked up  and we'd named more judges in that time period than previous administrations  and more women and minorities than the three previous presidents -- Democratic and Republican -- combined.
nonapplause And while we have had our fair share of good fortune  it flowed from a set of ideas and policies that we implemented.
nonapplause So if they can do it here  then all the schools out there can do it.
nonapplause They do not know about the importance.
nonapplause We will have new opportunities and new challenges.
nonapplause I think we're ready to assume that responsibility.
nonapplause If he's here  or was here  anyway -- and if you're not here  I still think you're great.
nonapplause All you need to do is just walk into the polling booth  put your hand on the lever  and say read my lips: No new taxes!
nonapplause This war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a decisive ideological struggle  and the security of our nation is in the balance.
nonapplause Now  why in the wide world they would oppose something that we are doing together that is working is beyond me.
nonapplause The people of this country will be able to say  we elected them; they went to Washington; they did what they said they were going to do  and the people are better off for it.
nonapplause I've got four grandchildren  two daughters and they deserve for us to be responsible  to sit down and figure this out and figure out how we are going to deal with it going forward so that  in fact  they know there will be something there for them when they get ready to retire  that will provide that basic floor  if you will  that supplement  that add-on that guarantees that they'll be able to live and enjoy retirement and not suffer what so many Americans suffered in that period before there was a Social Security system.
nonapplause Our unprecedented actions to stimulate growth and restart the flow of credit will help create jobs and prosperity within our borders and within yours.
nonapplause It's time to create new jobs  to build and rebuild industry  and to give the American people room to do what they do best.
nonapplause As this strong growth continues in the new century our farmers and ranchers will need to feed millions and millions of more people around the world.
nonapplause They shouldn't see it as an opportunity to enact unjustifiable rate increases that don't boost care and inflate their bottom line.
nonapplause When my wife was growing up in a suburb of Chicago  I'll never forget my father-in-law and my mother-in-law talking about how it was an overwhelmingly Republican place.
nonapplause The month I swore -- I was sworn in  we lost nearly 800 000 jobs -- that month  January 2009; 600 000 the next month; 600 000 the month after that.
nonapplause We're not stuck there as some of the other candidates are saying  and it's kind of surprising to be alone among all the Democratic candidates in the Iowa caucuses to say  "Look  we have to get the U.N. in and the U.S. out of Iraq."
nonapplause We see ourselves in a springtime of hope  ready to fire up our courage and determination to reach high and achieve all the best.
nonapplause And the heart of our country is strong.
nonapplause But even as they were making that promise  they were drafting a blueprint for rule -- what is now called the 72-hour document because it came out of a secret 3-day meeting.
nonapplause So if you give vouchers you take a relatively large amount of money away from the school budget for a relatively small number of people.
nonapplause We've been blessed with a vast and beautiful land and with an energetic and enterprising people.
nonapplause If you have the opportunity  just reach out and simply say thank you -- sometimes that goes a long way -- say thank you to the spouses and the children of our military members and thank them for their sacrifice because it is real and it is powerful.
nonapplause Yes!
nonapplause So we turned this deficit thing around.
nonapplause I said  well  I think the economy will get better if we balance the budget.
nonapplause There's a lot of talk about Medicare and Medicaid.
nonapplause Throughout the Asia Pacific region and the entire world  you are seen as a beacon of strength and freedom and democracy.
nonapplause And more recently  we have learned that the trade deficit in September declined for the second month in a row and is now 30 percent below its peak.
nonapplause And as we talk about saving Social Security for the 21st century  one of the things we ought to be doing is making special provisions for women who could not pay into Social Security at the same amount men could  and who therefore are much more likely to be living in poverty.
nonapplause And if local governments around this country can establish enterprise zones to create economic growth  then we can elect people to the Congress who will free our national enterprise zones bill.
nonapplause This force is on the hunt for the remaining Taliban and al Qaeda members.
nonapplause Or will we walk with those of us who believe that we need a smaller and less bureaucratic government  but government has a role to play to make sure that every American has a chance to make it  that every family has a chance to make it  that every neighborhood and every community has a chance to live up to the fullest of their God-given capacities?
nonapplause End quote.
nonapplause We have focused world attention on forced labor on the Soviet pipeline and Soviet repression in Poland and all the other nations that make up what is called the "fourth world" -- those living under totalitarian rule who long for freedom.
nonapplause We do have to balance the budget.
nonapplause It's actually more than that.
nonapplause And he can still play par golf but at the end of the hole  he can't remember the clubs he used or the score he made.
nonapplause I call you to national service because it is only that together we can advance a tradition rooted in our people's history  helping our people to help themselves.

nonapplause He said  "I always have and I guess I'll keep on doing it."
nonapplause ﻿  Vice President's Remarks and Q&A at a Town Hall Meeting on Strengthening Social Security
nonapplause There's the fact that in recent years we've been reestablishing a bipartisan consensus of foreign policy.
nonapplause Most of these initiatives share at least one common feature -- they will mean new  clean American jobs for our future.
nonapplause I'm having a good time  actually  going out and campaigning for other people.
nonapplause I wanted to be President because I felt that our country needed to take a new course if we were going to prepare for the 21st century so that for all of you  the American Dream of opportunity would be alive for everyone who was responsible enough to seize it; so that our country would still be a leading force for peace and freedom and prosperity and security in the world; and so that we would come together across all the lines that divide us into one America  bound in no small measure by citizen service.
nonapplause If anyone had said 50 years ago  what we're going to do with all this freedom in 50 years is have a flowering African American middle class  an enormous explosion of entrepreneurs  unparalleled achievement by hoards of young professionals and a dark flip side in which people are killing each other with reckless abandon and people's lives are being lost  and more and more young people are living in chaos  and gangs which people have feared have been created  I am convinced  to do nothing more than fill the vacuum which has been created by the absence of family and community  of effective schooling and strong community organizations and hope -- no one would have believed it.
nonapplause But  when you cut the people out of it  you have violated the very principle on which our whole way of government and self-government is supposed to be based.
nonapplause Counter-terrorism budgets were hugely increased.
nonapplause And she urged me to get ahead with the business and solve them.
nonapplause So there's a lot of overlap  if people will take time to sit down and look at it.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause The suffering of America -- the deep and painful recession  and the outrageous and frightening inflation -- these things didn't start by accidental ignition or spontaneous combustion.
nonapplause We know that.
nonapplause And that's why my immediate priority is not only providing relief to people who are out of work  but also to help the private sector create jobs and put America back to work.
nonapplause One by one  they were meeting their fate  a fate they chose for themselves.
nonapplause And I think you know how deeply grateful I am  not only to all of you for being out here but for a long-time and good friend  Bob Hope  to come here and interrupt his trip home to be here with us.
nonapplause I ought to go to work.
nonapplause If elected  Senator Kerry has promised to repeal most of the Bush tax cuts within his first 100 days in office.
nonapplause And so that's what I want to talk about today.
nonapplause I knew no one in Chicago when I arrived  was without money or family connections.
nonapplause One of the real keys is at the community and neighborhood level -- people like yourselves.
nonapplause And the solution is the line-item veto and the balanced budget amendment.
nonapplause But the battle is barely begun.
nonapplause And he hasn't made the transition  if you will  to what is required and is necessary if we're going to be successful going forward in dealing with what is a significant threat to the United States in the years ahead.
nonapplause So most Americans think we give more than we do and most people think foreign aid is not effectively spent.
nonapplause And that's where the squawking started.
nonapplause And let me pledge to you: Our goal is to keep America strong  to save the West from mutual nuclear terror  to make ballistic missiles obsolete  and ultimately to remove them from the face of the Earth.
nonapplause In the election this year  we're going to have a basic fundamental debate and decision over these fundamental issues -- because there are big differences between the positions the President and I have taken  the work we've done now for three-and-a-half years  versus the record of our opponents.
nonapplause Now we have an opportunity that is real and genuine to build on that progress.
nonapplause And Illinois is very  very fortunate to have him.
nonapplause Cutting the top rate for the very wealthy  eliminating the estate tax completely  even for $100 million estates  except you have to die within ten years because they were doing Enron accounting to try to make it look like it wasn't really that expensive to do that.
nonapplause To get there  we've got to have a lot of new ideas  but we have to be faithful to our fundamental values -- to supporting freedom and responsibility; to helping families raise their children; to helping all people make the most of their own lives; to holding people accountable for what they do that is destructive of our common purposes; to standing up for America here at home and for our best values and our better selves around the world; to finding common ground instead of cheap  short run  partisan gain; and to doing what is important for the long run  even if it's unpopular in the short-run.
nonapplause The country was in the ditch.
nonapplause So the society is beginning to grow together.
nonapplause And so  we cut our personal income tax rates by 25 percent.
nonapplause I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction.
nonapplause Those are our priorities.
nonapplause And this burst of bipartisanship that we're feeling right now can't be temporary.
nonapplause Leavitt understands it  and I think Senator Hatch understands it.
nonapplause Just say no!"
nonapplause Colonel Caine.
nonapplause I want to welcome everybody to the White House.

nonapplause And he'll foster more job opportunities by expanding markets for America's products around the world.
nonapplause They're bonds of an aspirational community -- you and your mothers and fathers  and brothers and sisters who struggled and sacrificed to realize the American Dream.
nonapplause The President wanted to seize new opportunities for reform -- and to get beyond old debates that stood in the way of progress.
nonapplause If they hadn't  they'd probably have over 40 nuclear bombs by now.

nonapplause To start with  we can't compete as a nation if the irresponsibility of a few folks on Wall Street can bring our entire economy to its knees.

nonapplause We will move forward with ratification of the Test Ban Treaty  and work with others to bring the treaty into force so that nuclear testing is permanently prohibited.
nonapplause Let me also thank General Sterling and Command Sergeant Major Savusa.
nonapplause Now -- and I believe with all my heart that there is a bipartisan  American consensus now that we ought to keep pushing more police officers on the street  working with communities  preventing crime from happening in the first place  catching people when they do something wrong as quickly as possible  making the streets safer.
nonapplause There are so many issues that I would like to talk about today but with a crowd like this  you've been waiting some time  you're standing here all jammed up together and I know that certainly the responsibility of whoever is the speaker is to bring his message quickly  bringing it in an understandable way  so that you can have an opportunity to know the issues which should decide this election.
nonapplause Now that Jerry Denton is in the Senate  courage and patriotism continue to distinguish all that he does.
nonapplause Well  at least I'm not them.
nonapplause He has improved the Afghan Eradication Force this is mobile units that can deploy across the country to help governors in their eradication efforts.
nonapplause Only Dennis Skinner remained glued to his seat.
nonapplause For as we learned on that fateful day  America's stake in this struggle is very clear: The security of our citizens is inextricably linked to the success of freedom and moderation and  yes  democracy in the Middle East.
nonapplause You think about this in the context of what we've been through now in the World Trade Center and the Middle East and all this.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at the American University in Dubai Commencement Exercise 2002
nonapplause I've learned from my various positions in your administration  Mr. President  that one of our most fundamental strengths and sources of influence around the world comes from the strength of our economy  which you  Vice President Gore  Secretary Rubin  Deputy Secretary Summers  Gene Sperling and others have helped create.
nonapplause Senator Durbin  thank you for those wonderful remarks and for your friendship.
nonapplause And with George W. Bush leading the nation  we are serious  and we will not let down our guard.
nonapplause Think about that.
nonapplause A fair number of those customers like Wal-Mart so much that they go on to work with the company  and you now have more than a million associates.
nonapplause Millions of Americans led a life of daily economic terror  fueled by those unrelenting costs.
nonapplause For example  I've been in a lot of airports in my life and nearly everybody I've ever met is honest in an airport -- 99.9 percent of the people in airports are perfectly honest  they bear me no ill will  and they're overcrowded anyway  and people are frustrated and they're often late  and if you walk through one of those metal detectors and you've got a big  heavy money clip or an elaborate belt or something  you're liable to set it off three or four times  and you're angry and frustrated  and I'm just sick of it  and so I just think we ought to take those metal detectors out of the airport  and the next time somebody blows up an airplane  we ought to throw the book at them.
nonapplause I've heard him speak clearly about the welfare of the people of Mexico.

nonapplause So we're helping to prepare a new generation of Iraqi military commanders  who will lead the security forces of a free and sovereign Iraq.
nonapplause Many of them are on the fence right now about whether to bring in that extra worker or two  or whether they should hire anyone at all.
nonapplause Of course it's not true.
nonapplause To honor my friend  Daisy Bates and Wylie Branton and Thurgood Marshall  the NAACP  and all who guided these children; to honor President Eisenhower  Attorney General Brownell  and the men of the 101st Airborne who enforced the Constitution; to honor every student  every teacher  every minister  every Little Rock resident  black or white  who offered a word of kindness  a glance of respect  or a hand of friendship; to honor those who gave us the opportunity to be part of this day of celebration and rededication.
nonapplause So in the famous words of Bill Clinton in the 1992 convention  after he spoke for hours and hours  in conclusion and then he got a standing ovation  I want to conclude with this.
nonapplause His regime cultivated ties to terror  including the al Qaeda network  and had built  possessed  and used weapons of mass destruction.
nonapplause Americans are uniting now as they always have in times of adversity.
nonapplause And once you know a place like that  you can't possibly imagine something like this occurring.
nonapplause But from the very first  our proposal has been to the Soviet Union  and made again in Iceland  that if and when such a system is developed  we will ask them to join us in watching the testing  and then we will join in both sides eliminating all nuclear missiles at the same time we share the defensive system.
nonapplause I am honored to do that.
nonapplause Our working group will learn from and work with state officials  business and labor folks and leaders from every walk of life who care about this issue.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause We Americans are incredibly proud to have been your partners in the peaceful reunification of Europe.
nonapplause I want thank all the state and local officials who are here.
nonapplause We want open markets.
nonapplause There are actually two changes that frame our conversation.
nonapplause I have not been the least bit tempted to apply the slave passages to myself.
nonapplause And the committee begins functioning in behalf of the need."
nonapplause In 1954  it was 79.
nonapplause Well  nearly 13 500 000 jobs have been created since the expansion began  and that averages out to 240 000 new jobs in this country a month.
nonapplause Look -- all over America today  the schools are working better.
nonapplause The Congress is more evenly divided and because the Republicans have done the last reapportionment or two it's harder for us to win back.
nonapplause We welcome this charge of history and we are keeping it.
nonapplause Our son was a soldier."
nonapplause I'm not making this up.
nonapplause Three weeks into the war -- which I want to talk about this morning -- I  obviously  cannot begin my remarks without paying tribute to those that we've lost on the field of battle.
nonapplause And so I am a huge supporter of the direction of policy that we have followed so far.
nonapplause We want to save Social Security and Medicare before we spend the surplus.
nonapplause Which way are you going to try going forward?
nonapplause It's the concern about the future of our young people.
nonapplause We are going to drive down costs.
nonapplause He's not naive.
nonapplause We were proud to live in North Carolina  a state that protected a woman's right to choose even before Roe.
nonapplause And last night he said some things which made it clear that he was prepared to take some bold strokes  bold steps to try to move the Japanese economy forward  restore growth and opportunity.
nonapplause The American people still want it  and they still need it.
nonapplause We had -- we enjoyed it at the White House  as well.
nonapplause I'm profoundly honored.
nonapplause I'll sign it into law.
nonapplause Nearly half the human race struggles to survive on less than $2 a day; nearly a billion live in chronic hunger; half the children in the poorest countries are not in school.
nonapplause And I want to thank you for your leadership and your commitment to our young people.
nonapplause During the period when this eavesdropping was still secret  the president seemed to go out of his way to reassure the American people on more than one occasion that  of course  judicial permission is required for any government spying on American citizens and that  of course  these constitutional safeguards were still in place.
nonapplause Your return has been greatly anticipated by the American people  and as you have gathered from the welcome of the children and the not-so-young  all Americans are very  very happy to see you.
nonapplause But I'll go even further: Pete Dawkins is one of the finest candidates I've ever known.
nonapplause My attitude is  if you receive federal money  you ought to measure to determine whether or not the money is being spent properly.
nonapplause They have the vote.
nonapplause They blew off the cap and said  this is working -- and I've been in some of them out there  they are working -- we want 100 a year.
nonapplause Take nuclear weapons  for example.
nonapplause If you can't do it at school  if you don't live in a community where you have sports teams and things like that  if you can't play outside because neighborhoods aren't safe  right  so your parents want to keep you inside  if you're watching too much TV and playing too many computer games --   -- sometimes that cuts into your ability to move.
nonapplause It's about more groceries and a car  more school clothes for the kids and more encouragement and hope to keep doing the right thing.
nonapplause Whatever happens in the future.
nonapplause It's an agenda that basically offers two answers to every problem we face: more tax breaks for the wealthy and fewer rules for corporations.
nonapplause But when we find failure  instead of accepting the status quo  do something about it.
nonapplause "How about potatoes?"
nonapplause I was especially delighted because  as some of you may know  Judge Scalia is the first Italian-American to be nominated to the Supreme Court in history.
nonapplause We go out.
nonapplause We talked about the plan to certify 100 000 master teachers  to make absolutely sure that they are academically well qualified to the highest degree  and then to get those people paid more so we can put one master teacher in every school building in America to try to change the culture of learning and the standards of learning.
nonapplause I want to thank the National Geographic for giving us a place to make this announcement and for all the years of helping people to understand the universe and this small planet.
nonapplause I'm proud that Bruce Gordon is here.
nonapplause We're very grateful to you as well.
nonapplause Look what they say they're for.
nonapplause And that's why we come here today to sign this executive order.
nonapplause I said to General Secretary Gorbachev  "Dovorey no provorey."
nonapplause This is the privilege and responsibility we share.
nonapplause Preserve America Communities  Neighborhoods  and Grant recipients know the importance of historic preservation to the economic  educational  esthetic  and cultural life of America  as well as to their residents  their visitors  and especially to their children.
nonapplause It is the basis of Labour's hocus pocus manifesto in which the slickness of style deceives the eye.
nonapplause And I -- and speaking for those people over there in that particular section -- tell you  you'll be amazed a half a century down the road at how clearly and how warmly the memories of these last few years will stay with you and how much they'll mean to you.
nonapplause But he did a superb job for everybody here in Nebraska.
nonapplause Will you please do the same."
nonapplause How can this man laugh?
nonapplause But these things matter.
nonapplause Let me just say something to the younger folks here -- those of us who do not have my hair color -- one of the advantages of age -- and they're less than I thought there were when I was 25...
nonapplause In 1960  he left Mexico  no money  and he couldn't speak the language.
nonapplause They're tempted to give up  to opt out  and to hide from reality and responsibility.
nonapplause These development projects brought safe and affordable housing to Chattanooga's families.
nonapplause Nobody else can do it.
nonapplause When military force has been used as an instrument of foreign policy or in response to humanitarian demands  it has almost always been as the result of presidential initiative and leadership.
nonapplause But unless people understand this in a bigger framework  there will always be places that are behind and places that are ahead.
nonapplause And I say that  having eliminated more government programs  more government regulations  and reduced the size of the government more than any Republican President in the last 50 years.
nonapplause With the balanced program we've proposed of supporting the economic progress  democratic development  and security needs of our neighbors and friends  we can succeed.
nonapplause And if our cities can create thriving neighborhoods that offer excellence in education  efficiency and affordability  safety on -- but drugs and crime off -- our streets  then they can become great centers of growth  diversity  and excitement  filled with sound  colors  warmth  and delight.
nonapplause Don Regan has Merrill Lynch setting up real estate offices throughout the country.
nonapplause Listen; I have been to the Soviet Union.
nonapplause It's a great honor to be with you tonight.
nonapplause First  that Britain's reputation as a staunch and reliable ally  and a person who said fearlessly in international conferences precisely what we meant  Britain's reputation abroad rides very high in the world.
nonapplause And I'm not going to promise you today that if Cabot Lodge and I are elected we're going to solve them all  and that all the sailing's going to be smooth  because it isn't.
nonapplause We talked about private investment  the lifeblood of economies  and the difficulty of turning around perceptions  especially when they come from living in a bad neighborhood next to a country mired in conflict.
nonapplause And so  one can't help but believe they knew what they were doing when they quite consciously left the responsibility to educate the American people up to the States.
nonapplause What did they vote against?
nonapplause I said I'm from Arkansas.
nonapplause And she said  they tell me there are 20 000 to 30 000 children a year in foster care that turn 18 and are just turned out.
nonapplause If we'd had one these last 2 years  we could have done much more.
nonapplause And when he comes down here and says his ideas are best for the South  he's handing you the ultimate Mason-Dixon Line.
nonapplause I don't think that there is any doubt that the road for peace ahead can be won if we maintain our own vitality here in the United States and around the world.
nonapplause We cut government growth  slashed regulations  and cut income taxes almost 25 percent.
nonapplause First  as I have said  we must strengthen and protect the guarantee of Social Security for the 21st century.
nonapplause Today  as Lou said  there are about 50 million people in 150 countries connected to the Information Superhighway.
nonapplause History has proven that democracies are peaceful -- yield the peaceful countries.
nonapplause The most amazing thing about our men and women in uniform is that even as they fight to defeat terror  they still have an enormous capacity to extend the hand of friendship and compassion to people who desperately want a better life.
nonapplause It changes color  gets all strange looking  and alien things start to feed on it.
nonapplause We got a lot to do up there.
nonapplause Now  I know that all of you remember last year  when I filled out my bracket --   -- I picked North Carolina to win it all.
nonapplause I believe  especially as it relates to bringing us together  the keys are education  economic empowerment  and racial reconciliation.
nonapplause The trick is how to extend affordable coverage of all these miracles and basic preventive health care to all Americans.
nonapplause And I want you to understand that you carry with you the great burden and opportunity of American history.
nonapplause A lot of you have been going to these events that I do  and I had this little mantra -- I'll say it again  I say I always tell people there are three very important things you need to know about this election.
nonapplause And they did so.
nonapplause They're tops.
nonapplause I give you our special thanks for having you play for us here today.
nonapplause You know  back at the beginning of World War II  as we entered that terrible war  General George C. Marshall  the Chief of Staff of the United States Army  was asked if we had a secret weapon and  if so  what it might be?
nonapplause "When millions were murdered  why was I allowed to live?"
nonapplause There has been something very special about the friendships between the leaders of our two countries and may I say to my friend the Prime Minister  I would like to add two more names to this list of affection—Thatcher and Reagan.
nonapplause And the three points I want to make are  number one  this is a big election.
nonapplause And I could go on -- 90 percent of our kids were immunized against serious childhood diseases for the first time in the history of the United States.
nonapplause Voter registration will start next month and free and fair elections will be held in Iraq this coming January.
nonapplause So what should she do?
nonapplause Now  no one knows better than those of us here in this Republican gathering that the people of New Jersey may be overwhelmingly registered in the other party.
nonapplause These are times of change for our nation  but they're also years of promise.
nonapplause Saturday was always the shopping day.
nonapplause And we have a lot of other members of the administration here from other departments in the White House.
nonapplause Once again  congratulations on your accomplishments  and good luck in the years to come.
nonapplause I think we ought to do that.
nonapplause So not all the sermons and not all the travel has accomplished everything that we would like.
nonapplause Now  what's been happening is  up until very recently we've been running a surplus in the Social Security account.
nonapplause As a nation  our goal should be to protect individual freedom while fostering responsible decision-making  an approach that seeks to protect the right to choose while reducing the number of abortions.
nonapplause And I think that every parent should take heart that people who throw water balloons and scale to third-floor windows do have a future --   -- that will in one way or another be redemptive.
nonapplause But there are those who do well and those who are not doing so well  who are not positioned yet to win in this new age of possibility.
nonapplause They said that it was institutionalized inflation in our system; no way to get rid of it.
nonapplause We know if you go to any children's hospital in any sizeable city today  and you go to the ward where the little babies are  you'll see baby after baby after baby born with an addiction to drugs.
nonapplause This is an issue  in my view  which seeks to take a legitimate principle  which is that people should not have their money spent against their will  and turn it into a ballot initiative that will simply put organizations that represent working people at a significant competitive disadvantage to other organizations in the political marketplace.
nonapplause There is a little woman.
nonapplause You can see  it has a keyboard that is suitable for people who are three inches tall --   -- but  apart from that  it's a minor detail  everything else works.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the People of the Chicago Area
nonapplause He's respected by colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
nonapplause In other words  we're using all assets of this great nation in order to defeat this enemy.
nonapplause This time  the call for reform is coming from the bottom up and from all across the spectrum -- from doctors  from nurses  from patients; from unions  from businesses; from hospitals  health care providers  community groups.
nonapplause And from the start  I've insisted that the financial industry  not taxpayers  shoulder the costs in the event that a large financial company should falter.
nonapplause That's why the NGA's efforts to support this issue and to provide best practice is going to be so valuable.
nonapplause For years  we've talked about bad statistics and an achievement gap.
nonapplause As we fight the terrorists  we are also helping the people they have persecuted.
nonapplause Major of the Army  McKinney.
nonapplause It's a privilege for me to speak where they have spoken  and to pray where they have prayed.
nonapplause Now  I don't know.
nonapplause Just a short while ago  this afternoon  Hillary and I visited the gravesite of Prime Minister Rabin with Mrs. Rabin  her daughter and granddaughter.
nonapplause We're here to make America stronger at home so that she can get ahead.
nonapplause Same argument applies to health care.
nonapplause Thank you  Doug Dougherty and all the other labor leaders who are here.
nonapplause We're the most generous people on Earth.
nonapplause As part of our proposal  we've asked the Congress of the United States to release $14 million for food  medicine  and other support to help the patriots who believe in democracy survive in the hills of Nicaragua.
nonapplause We start to ignore all those amendments that remind us of our God-given rights.
nonapplause I want you to know one thing  that any family in America that can get in an automobile can go in that national park for $10 bucks a car.
nonapplause It was the product of a remarkable concerted endeavor by tens of millions of Americans.
nonapplause And Nancy answered  "Just say no."
nonapplause And just let me say how grateful I am for you making me feel so much at home.
nonapplause In 8th grade math  we've fallen to 9th place.
nonapplause We're working together through NATO in training the forces of Iraq  a country that is trying to learn the hard work of democracy  the hard work of putting democratic institutions to the service of solving conflicts between people rather than using violence and repression to do so.
nonapplause Today  we're actually taking in a lot more money from Social Security taxes enacted in 1983 than we're spending out.
nonapplause They're not certified teachers  but they are adults and because there's very few disabled kids with para-professionals that need a hundred percent all the time  so that frees up the para-professionals to help once in a while with some of the teacher's duties  teaching duties.
nonapplause We accept that duty.
nonapplause You just heard why.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause And  by the way  when you talk to the CEO of Ford  he'll tell you that wouldn't have been good for Ford either  because a lot of those suppliers that they depend on might have gone out of business.
nonapplause So  I am not being sanctimonious about this.
nonapplause No one is free in America when large numbers of our fellow citizens must always be looking over their shoulders.
nonapplause And yet too often  these words are ignored.
nonapplause By standing with our friends  we are making a better day possible in the broader Middle East  and helping to build a safer  more peaceful world for our children and our grandchildren.
nonapplause If it is not  there is no cause for adjournment.
nonapplause You know  we've got an Africa trade initiative coming up.
nonapplause If you get around 3 percent  it's almost functionally zero  because people are just moving around in their lives.
nonapplause I am deeply honored to be here with you this evening.
nonapplause At bottom  they ignored our responsibility to work for constructive change  not simply to try to preserve the status quo.
nonapplause He's combined brilliant business success and dedicated public service.
nonapplause Like every American and the majority of IRS employees  who are trying hard to do their jobs well  I get outraged when I hear about abuses in the IRS.
nonapplause But hold on; he's got more.
nonapplause All over the world people are fighting because of their differences.
nonapplause It's racial and ethnic and religious hatred and dehumanization.
nonapplause It's a perfectly good convention  but  frankly  it has no teeth.
nonapplause We are saying the government should enhance opportunity  but should insist on responsibility.
nonapplause We literally in our lifetimes have gone from the horse and buggy to space travel and landing on the Moon.
nonapplause And I expect the United States Congress to get the defense bill to my desk quickly.
nonapplause Now  if you have ideas and imagination  the information technology has virtually collapsed the meaning of distance  and it's made the human mind and ideas even more important than riches in the ground.
nonapplause That is a Massachusetts joke.
nonapplause And economic recovery not only helps the American people; it helps bring down government deficits.
nonapplause But my favorite visit was in 1986 when I taught for three weeks at the National Defense Academy in Yokosuka -- which you know is the home of Prime Minister Koizumi  and we've had a chance to talk about that on a number of occasions.
nonapplause It must be about what we can do together.
nonapplause Education produces many social benefits  and perhaps none greater than better health.
nonapplause But we should not do it by lowering our standards.
nonapplause The father wrote in that article  "My children somehow have settled on a place where it is their assumption that this country is right and just unless they are shown otherwise."
nonapplause They have called us all to compassion  humility and understanding.
nonapplause As the Bush doctrine makes clear  those who harbor terrorists share guilt for the acts they commit.
nonapplause And I recounted for many that may not have known  the circumstances of Dr. King's death.
nonapplause We had the bombing at the World Trade Center in New York in 1993; the murders at the Saudi National Guard Training Center in Riyadh in 1995; the attack on the Khobar Towers in 1996; the simultaneous bombings of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998  the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000; and  of course  ultimately  the attacks here at home on the Pentagon and New York when we lost 3 000 on 9/11.
nonapplause Fourth  we are determined to deny the terrorists control of any nation  which they would use as a home base and staging ground for terrorist attacks on others.
nonapplause Now  you think about the future.
nonapplause This will be deductible earnings that he can put aside.
nonapplause They'd cut the MX missiles  our strategic defense against ballistic missiles.
nonapplause You might be interested to know that it was exactly 92 years ago today  on January 11  1908  that he designated the Grand Canyon as one of our nation's first national monuments.
nonapplause And we're counting on you to help in that.
nonapplause This is not about more tests.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a Wyoming Republican Party Rally in Casper
nonapplause So  I just never considered that I needed to take an additional journey or expand the boundaries of my own life.
nonapplause And  Robert  congratulations.
nonapplause As all of our winners know  quality is not something that comes in a "one-size-fits-all" package.
nonapplause We agreed on the next steps: negotiating a 50-percent reduction in strategic nuclear forces and an interim agreement to cover intermediate-range missiles.
nonapplause First  we shall introduce a core of basic subjects which will be taught to all children.
nonapplause The veterans in this hall understand the loss and sadness that have come to military families.
nonapplause Let me say that I understand that every society has certain sectors which are especially sensitive to trade-opening initiatives.
nonapplause It's already the longest peacetime expansion in history; in February it'll be the longest economic expansion  including those that embraced our world wars.
nonapplause I ask you also to help me to give that sense of possibility back to the American people.
nonapplause We've raised the minimum wage.
nonapplause On July 1st  uninsured Americans who've been locked out of the insurance market because of a preexisting condition will now be able to enroll in a new national insurance pool where they'll finally be able to purchase quality  affordable health care -- some for the very first time in their lives.
nonapplause Yes  sir  back here.
nonapplause And with your help and God's grace  we'll all have cause to cheer just one week from today.
nonapplause But we live in an interdependent world and we literally cannot make of it what it ought to be unless we make it a home for all the children of the world.
nonapplause But all of us trace back to this experience of parents  grandparents  great-grandparents building this American Dream -- not having much to begin with.
nonapplause Including a World War II veteran  one of the great living Americans  Senator Bob Dole.
nonapplause What we have done is started a national conversation.
nonapplause I know about half of you were in the other room  and I'm loath to repeat my speech -- although I'm reminded once I went to -- I once went to a concert when I was governor of Arkansas that Tina Turner held in Little Rock.
nonapplause And we've been through natural disasters.
nonapplause I walked up and down the street with a 17-year-old girl that is as intelligent as any high school child I've talked to since I've been President.
nonapplause You have the educational tools to meet it.
nonapplause And we are determined now to make something positive happen out of that  to use it to strengthen our ability to stand for peace.
nonapplause Please be seated  relax.
nonapplause But we honor you here today not just for your creations and your innovations but for the inspiration that all of you are providing to the next generation of creators and innovators and thinkers.
nonapplause Last Thursday  Secretary Perry awarded the first 14 of these well-deserved recognitions.
nonapplause And the greater the problems and changes the children will face  the greater the need to conserve tried and trusted values.
nonapplause There are things that are important for votes  and then there are things that are important for life and for who we are as a people.
nonapplause One  you tend to forget things and -- I can't remember the other two.
nonapplause This I want to be my gift to you.
nonapplause Well  of course they can't  because it highlights how far they  the leadership today of the Democratic Party  has strayed from the strength of the democratic political tradition.
nonapplause But the people that do need services get services when that child is 2 weeks old  not when they arrive at the schoolhouse door at 5 years of age and the kindergarten teacher says  "Oh  my Lord  imagine what's been going on at home."
nonapplause We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy -- and chief among them is freedom from fear.
nonapplause We've gone to big deficits.
nonapplause Throughout the time that I've been a member of the Council  most of our debates were defined by the Cold War.
nonapplause What kind of laws should we have to make sure that as more and more parents are working  they can work and still have time for their kids  and save enough to make sure their kids can go to college?
nonapplause ﻿  Mrs. Bush's Remarks at a Thelma Drake for Congress Breakfast
nonapplause It includes securing vulnerable nuclear materials  a goal we advanced at our Nuclear Security Summit  where I thanked Prime Minister Singh for committing India to building a new center of excellence for nuclear energy and security.
nonapplause You've chosen to live out the words of Saint Paul: "Be not overcome of evil  but overcome evil with good."
nonapplause Tom believes in the principles of educational accountability and excellence that define the President's No Child Left Behind Act.
nonapplause Together you are "One Team."
nonapplause You get an employment contract if you win.
nonapplause And now it is my high honor to once again introduce him to you  his friends and strong supporters -- ladies and gentlemen  the President of the United States.
nonapplause I had lunch with President Medvedev this afternoon  and we started talking about health issues and the continuing high mortality rate among Russian men in particular.
nonapplause But these men and women  like the men and women who are here  embody it.
nonapplause The people that negotiated that with us deserve the thanks of their country.
nonapplause Now  having said all that  whoever you voted for  you ought to be in a pretty good frame of mind tonight  for the following reasons.
nonapplause O  be swift  my soul  to answer Him!
nonapplause And if we are going to be that kind of country  that means we have to take a new direction.
nonapplause And as a former governor  I understand one size does not fit all when it comes to education.
nonapplause The terrorists are still plotting and planning  trying to find ways to attack the United States.
nonapplause and had a great lunch.
nonapplause What programs to move our country forward?
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the First Lady at Tea for Military Women
nonapplause The most important thing is to pass a bill that has real deficit reduction  real spending cuts  put it all in a trust fund so the money can't go to anything else  and no tax increases without the spending cuts  and keep the interest rates down.
nonapplause You know  I didn't know then  obviously  I would ever be President.
nonapplause I suppose it's the last remaining ideological battle within the Democratic Party about what kind of party we're going to be going into the future.
nonapplause He said  "I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it."
nonapplause I am proud of our record  but I say we've got to move forward on that record because the world isn't standing still  and I pledge to you that we will keep America the strongest nation militarily  that we will move forward to a great era of progress in which all Americans move together  a better life for our children than we have for ourselves  but most of all  we're going  also  to keep the ideals of America strong because  remember  if we're going to win the struggle for peace and freedom  we need a burning patriotism  faith in the rightness of our cause  belief that we're going to win.
nonapplause It hasn't always been easy.
nonapplause Already because of NAFTA we're exporting autos to Mexico at more than five times the rate of a year ago.
nonapplause Competition is a good thing  a needed thing  indeed the very thing on which our national progress is built.
nonapplause Global terrorism will be defeated only by global response.
nonapplause Even after the reductions which have been announced  they will still outnumber NATO's by at least 2 : 1.
nonapplause I said  I'll give you the same advice I give young people  fresh out of college that ask me this.
nonapplause On the other  a doctrine which holds that Government should have a central plan to cover every aspect of life and that people should conform  whatever their personal wishes.
nonapplause And you ought to be proud of that and feel good about it.
nonapplause When they told me that this man had actually blocked a born alive infant protection act in Illinois  that's not about--some people say it's about partial-birth abortion.
nonapplause We've been creating jobs at an average rate of almost a quarter of a million a month  for a total of nearly 14 million new jobs.
nonapplause And we need to keep the prosperity going -- because I know he'll work harder to extend the benefits of our prosperity to other people  whether it's the differences they have over the minimum wage or the patients' bill of rights  or you name it.
nonapplause We are kind of happy that we're here.
nonapplause There are none called Lenin or Trotsky or Stalin in the Congo  or Nixon.
nonapplause I'm so confident that we can achieve what we all want -- an educated tomorrow.
nonapplause The President and I welcome the discussion  because every voter in America needs to know how the leaders of the Democratic Party view the war on terror.
nonapplause The Air and Space Museum  both here and on the mall in Washington shows what can be accomplished with confidence  perseverance and unity of purpose.
nonapplause I don't know anybody  Ronald Reagan included  who's ever stepped into office and been able to fulfill all the promises and get the whole agenda done.
nonapplause I hope we've beat that back for a long time to come.
nonapplause And finally  a former public servant  a distinguished Tennessee citizen  a man whose son is -- sees my daughter at the University of Texas  hopefully in the library --   -- and that's Lamar Alexander.
nonapplause Since we cannot escape each other  we must go forward together.
nonapplause The President cannot do this alone.
nonapplause Today  nearly 14 million children in America play soccer; 40 percent of them are girls.
nonapplause All right
nonapplause Barack Obama?
nonapplause I remember how hard Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern  and George Mitchell  and all the leaders here worked on the Good Friday Accord.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President and the First Lady at the Kennedy Center Honors Reception
nonapplause No matter how bad it gets  don't forget there's someone who's endured more pain than you have.
nonapplause The prescription drugs keep people out of the hospital  they lengthen their lives  they make them richer -- this is a big deal.
nonapplause He ended his message saying  “Thank you  America  and farewell.
nonapplause For  in addition to the old debate about whether we should focus on punishment or prevention  and whether the federal government should make speeches or give money  there's a debate that  unfortunately  hasn't died out in Washington  and that's about whether it's better to strengthen the enforcement of the existing gun laws  or to have strengthened gun laws.
nonapplause It's going to come below where it is.
nonapplause James Madison wrote in a letter to Thomas Jefferson these words: "The Constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates  that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war and most prone to it.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause Individuals must take responsibility for their own actions.
nonapplause We'll put colleges and employers together to create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom.
nonapplause And really  over here  we would have called it a mom-and-pop place.
nonapplause Time and time again  we're seeing examples of Democratic Party leaders apparently having lost their perspective concerning the nature of the enemy we face  and the need to wage this fight aggressively.
nonapplause During the Carter era we faced an international crisis  and we had to find the will and wherewithal to meet it.
nonapplause People that are just working their hearts out on behalf of their fellow citizens  you can look in their eyes and see the exhaustion.
nonapplause We cannot simply assume every nation wants the peace that we so earnestly desire.
nonapplause Write it down on a piece of paper.
nonapplause Now  one of the main reasons this crisis could take place is that many agencies and regulators were responsible for oversight of individual financial firms and their subsidiaries  but no one was responsible for protecting the system as the whole -- as a whole.
nonapplause I was up for 39 hours at the end of those peace talks  and I never did that in college.
nonapplause Yes  it's a difficult but by no means impossible challenge.
nonapplause He understands you and me.
nonapplause We have to do more to strengthen our families  we have to do more to provide educational opportunity for all.
nonapplause But I would hope that every American would want the United States Congress and the private sector and everybody else to do whatever we can for Washington.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause But that deduction is essentially worthless when a company is struggling and losing money in this economy.
nonapplause Negro History Week
nonapplause As Arthur Vandenburg asked at the dawn of the Nuclear Age  after a German V-1 attack had left London in flames and its people in fear  "How can there be isolation when men can devise weapons like that?"
nonapplause But even if someone disagrees with you  that's what an election is about.
nonapplause He spends an average of 2\1/2\ days a week in Minnesota and still maintains a voting record in the Senate of 95 percent.
nonapplause But turn it around we did: We cut taxes  we simplified taxes  we reformed taxes.
nonapplause Those taxes come right out of cash flow  making it harder for small business owners to make investments that raise productivity  boost incomes  provide benefits to their workers.
nonapplause In these communities  there have been countless numbers of Americans who have succeeded and have made America a success story.
nonapplause And he put himself on the line  becoming the first State chairman to endorse me.
nonapplause There is a proper season for everything.
nonapplause And this  again  is something that you all can describe a lot better than I can.
nonapplause I am proud that we as an administration have made a difference in the life of every American.
nonapplause We're proud to have you on the team.
nonapplause But we salute the bravery  the courage -- moral  physical -- the faith  the determination of those who have come together today  not for the first time  Israelis and Palestinians  in this major step on the path to peace and reconciliation and driving away the shadows of darkness and despair and anger.
nonapplause So we need a comprehensive  coordinated approach to this problem.
nonapplause And this is one that is sometimes hard to explain to particularly younger voters.
nonapplause I think it is dedicated to the improvement of American agriculture  and it has been throughout its entire history since the time that a farmer  Thomas Jefferson  founded the Democratic Party.
nonapplause And this is the message we're going to be taking to every home in America: The future is bright  and it's getting brighter because we've been bringing good jobs and hopes and opportunity to all the citizens in this country.
nonapplause Velma Montoya was appointed just a few weeks ago to a major policy formulation position in the White House.
nonapplause No question  we will win the war on terror by staying on the offensive.
nonapplause Thank you all very much.
nonapplause And it may not be  because we could certainly say if we wanted to in this country today  that our drivers--we call them our leaders--have fallen asleep at the wheel.
nonapplause But the kid growing up didn't ask how he came into this world or when or with whom.
nonapplause We saw the work of UNIFEM  enabling women to use their other talents as well as bringing up their children  for business purposes which brought them both satisfaction  fulfilment and a little bit of independence—all very very important for women.
nonapplause Some of them are  but most of them aren't.
nonapplause These good times  taking advantage of them  and preparing for the long-term prosperity and success of the American people  and trying to advance the cause of peace and freedom and prosperity throughout the world.
nonapplause You did.
nonapplause But this country has huge challenges.
nonapplause Just eighteen months ago President Reagan spoke here in this Guildhall.
nonapplause Now  if you look at that  you have to ask yourself: How can you have -- how many people  if you did everything right down here  if we built this cultural center  of all the people that go to see Crazy Horse  of all the people that go to see Mt.
nonapplause And send back all that other A-Team  that I just mentioned a little while ago  to the Congress.
nonapplause And  Mr. President  the significant increase  the largest since Ronald Reagan was the President  shows the world  shows our friends  and as importantly  shows the enemy  that the United States is a determined  resolved nation.
nonapplause From these shores  it may seem to some of you that by comparison with the risk and sacrifice which America has borne through four decades and the courage with which you have shouldered unwanted burdens  Europe has not fully matched your expectations.
nonapplause And she came all the way from Wisconsin to do it  because she wanted to be a good citizen.
nonapplause He'll never be as big as he would have  but he's going to have a life.
nonapplause I have previously said  and I will say again today  all of us want to thank Senator Kerry for his service in Vietnam.
nonapplause It's what I call challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations.
nonapplause When I was a boy  most poor people were old.
nonapplause In the past decade  primary enrollments have increased at twice the rate -- twice the rate -- of the 1980s.
nonapplause And let me say  too  how much I value the strong  loyal support of your outstanding Congressman -- Dick Cheney.
nonapplause He called off business.
nonapplause I think it would be nice to show the world that America is still one nation under God.
nonapplause These aren't just numbers.
nonapplause In the past -- well  look at it this way -- it's long time passed for us to secure a just  two-state solution.
nonapplause They serve Virginia and they serve the Nation well.
nonapplause Now  little more than 40 years ago  astronauts descended the nine-rung ladder of the lunar module called Eagle  and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the Earth's only Moon.
nonapplause I think that's more meaningful than the unemployment rate that we keep flirting with.
nonapplause They have never failed us  and we must never fail them  but the best intentions and the highest morale are undermined by back- to-back deployments  by poor pay  by shortages of spare parts and equipment  and of rapidly declining readiness.
nonapplause In America  all are welcome.
nonapplause I ask your help.
nonapplause In the next few years Columbus' voyage will take on a heightened significance.
nonapplause We had to ship her in  even in the White House.
nonapplause And if they cannot  let's correct problems early  before it's too late.
nonapplause Today is the perfect day for a road trip with a few friends -?
nonapplause Brazil or Mexico  if they had our fiscal policy  they'd last about a nanosecond before their currency would collapse.
nonapplause Now  let me say that there are four principles which  if I am successful  will guide us in attempting to develop an agricultural policy.
nonapplause During the past ten years we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which has now justified the presence of U.S. military advisors in Venezuela.
nonapplause Now  the Crime Bill that you've heard everybody brag on -- I appreciate that  all the credit they're trying to give me.
nonapplause And there are problems to be dealt with and struggles to be had  and things to be laid down and set forth  and battles to be fought for this one and that one  but it was all done--consciously done  by the way--in deference to the providence and will of God.
nonapplause Let us be absolutely clear.
nonapplause Now let me talk just a little bit about why I'm running  and I think it's best described in two letters.
nonapplause Already 2 000 movie theaters have agreed to show the PSA on their screens.
nonapplause Now  see  that's diplomacy --   -- right there for an 11-year-old to sacrifice ice cream to shake the hand appropriately of a fellow ambassador.
nonapplause Are you ready to go?
nonapplause He must have been thinking about Syracuse and today when he said it.
nonapplause The none-too-subtle message to young people was that they had to use drugs if they wanted to be cool.
nonapplause Oh  they say  we're going to take it out of the rich  but they know very well they can't get it out of them.
nonapplause And let me pledge to you today: Our goal today is to save the West from mutual nuclear terror  to make ballistic missiles obsolete  and ultimately to eliminate them from the face of the Earth.
nonapplause And like I said  if you make the investment upfront  you  the individual consumer  will save money in the long term  and all of us collectively will be better off.
nonapplause All those "no" votes now form the basis of Senator Kerry's economic plan.
nonapplause We have tried to define what we think we should do together and what we think the nation's responsibilities are.
nonapplause That's why we have to do more for child care.
nonapplause Also  it is quite impossible to understand our history or literature without grasping this fact  and that's the strong practical case for ensuring that children at school are given adequate instruction in the part which the Judaic-Christian tradition has played in moulding our laws  manners and institutions.
nonapplause She wouldn't vote to shut the government down and get rid of the Department of Education  or get rid of the 100 000 police that lowered the crime rate in New York and other places.
nonapplause I'll never forget that Friday after the attack in New York   when the President went to Ground Zero.
nonapplause -- the crushing of human rights in Poland or the genocide in Cambodia.
nonapplause We will fulfill our responsibility to our forces and our families.
nonapplause It is a duty that falls on all of us -- the President  the Congress  and the people.
nonapplause Barney  the one year old Scottish Terrier  does not get to go.
nonapplause Others say we should cut science and technology  the most powerful engine we have to boost our economy.
nonapplause And that generates jobs  opportunities and incomes.
nonapplause But the Senate is now debating ratification of that first agreement ever to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons.
nonapplause It will take school administrators  board presidents  and local union leaders making collective bargaining a catalyst -- and not an impediment -- to reform.
nonapplause It is great -- and I do mean great -- to be here in Long Beach.
nonapplause You understand the nightmares that come when they are abused.
nonapplause He's been especially helpful in our effort to reduce taxes and spending.
nonapplause I thank Alan Solomont and Dan Dutko for being here and for their work for our Democratic Party.
nonapplause Imagine if Mother Teresa had never answered her calling and ventured into the streets of Calcutta to tend to those in desperate need.
nonapplause And now they run Mr. Nixon.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause If you look at business  for example -- I mentioned the economic changes -- I had to fight like crazy for the Family and Medical Leave law.
nonapplause And as Alaska's junior senator  she's focused on those issues that are most vital to Alaskans.
nonapplause And there is more work to be done  because we face ruthless and determined enemies.
nonapplause That's very different from what the other side is proposing.
nonapplause I've lived long enough now to know that nothing stays the same forever.
nonapplause We fought a war of revolution to make those words real in 1776.
nonapplause My friends  that's a great luxury.
nonapplause Now  after 200 years  and after 200 years of this university  we find ourselves a people of more than 150 different racial and ethnic groups confronting a challenge in this new era which tests our belief in the future  tests our courage to change  and tests our commitment to community -- to going up together.
nonapplause And it will save the taxpayers over $4 billion in just the first five years.
nonapplause Last week  we took the first bus tours of our last campaign.
nonapplause Well  part of it is  is that they just can't give up on the bankrupt economic policies that they have been peddling for much of the last decade.
nonapplause But it is all in a very very good cause and it is all on one single site and we have to do it on others.
nonapplause And we'll stand with the people of Iraq and Afghanistan while their hopes for freedom are being fulfilled.
nonapplause One of the things I love most about our country is that we have such opportunity.
nonapplause We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate  and more about the good we can do.
nonapplause Yet  our economy needs more than a pick-me-up  more than a one-time boost.
nonapplause But it would certainly be a mistake if Commission and Council of Ministers confined themselves next year to simply ticking off what has and what has not been implemented.
nonapplause Let me just go through now what I think we should do in challenging the country on standards for students  as well as for teachers and schools.
nonapplause I'll just give you one last idea.
nonapplause It has just been a thrill for me to be able to work with her on this issue and many others.
nonapplause We're going to talk to a soul who will tell you how important Social Security is to her and her family.
nonapplause When these children grow up and they're raising their children  I want this to be a country in a world that is so full of possibility it's unimaginable to us.
nonapplause We should be proud of that.
nonapplause I support this idea because clear back to the Revolutionary War  one of the great talents of American soldiers has been their marksmanship.
nonapplause But seriously  we can be proud of those seeking our nomination  and I'm certain that we all agree it would be an honor to have any one of them head up our ticket.
nonapplause I didn't make the low notes  and he did.
nonapplause We've still got a long way to go.
nonapplause YMCA  YWCA  kids outside.
nonapplause The intricate and finally balanced system  now in such danger  was created with the full and widespread participation of the population as a whole.
nonapplause In all of these areas  ownership is the path to opportunity  greater independence  and more control over your own life.
nonapplause A creative  competitive America is the answer to a changing world  not trade wars that would close doors  create greater barriers  and destroy millions of jobs.
nonapplause Well  there is no more dangerous risk to America or the loved ones that we'll leave behind us than deliberate  planned inflation that would destroy our country  and we're not going to permit that.
nonapplause And the question is again  what do we have to do as a nation  and in a larger sense  what do we have to do as a world  to take advantage of the marvelous engines of economic growth out there  in a way that spread the benefits to everybody and preserves the basic social safety net that enables families to raise their children in decency  the elderly to retire with a certain level of security  and all of us to pull together  in this society in a larger world that is growing ever more diverse in terms not only of race and ethnicity  but also religion.
nonapplause We can no longer afford to be a party that consists of too many who believe that their vote is to go to someone designated by the media for victory.
nonapplause I'm still trying to do that.
nonapplause And if you're going to think straight  you really must talk straight and be very precise in the way in which you use words.
nonapplause So think about that -- one in every three dollars by the time our kids get to be where we are.
nonapplause Unfortunately  too many young people today don't have that kind of support.
nonapplause He said  yeah  I will  I always have.
nonapplause This isn't just about smoother pavement and new bridges; it's about State Hill Constructors  a New York construction company who was able to rehire laid–off seasonal employees after winning contracts for some of the road projects the governor mentioned; it's about a highway in Illinois  dotted with potholes  being repaved by 120 new workers.
nonapplause You have given us a memory that we'll treasure forever.
nonapplause But for nearly four years now  Washington has ignored the middle class  putting wealth ahead of work  something for nothing ahead of responsibility.
nonapplause Be they farmers  shopkeepers  manufacturers  hotel keepers  together they provide services  variety  new products  new ideas—and new jobs.
nonapplause The last point I want to make is this -- something a long way from Arkansas usually is my foreign policy job  a lot of the challenges I face.
nonapplause Here's what he said -- he said  “May the responsibilities of freedom wake the best that is in you  and may its benefits be known by generations yet unborn.” Well  I would say the same thing to you today.
nonapplause But a lot of this work now will be done by word of mouth  one by one.
nonapplause But I think it's worth pointing out that where we are today is a function of the work of tens of millions of Americans in their own lives making the most of those lives  and also a direct function of the changes that we brought to Washington four and a half years ago.
nonapplause And in parallel  we must prepare the rainy season  which just last week has already caused the deaths of 15 people.
nonapplause And my dream is to see a day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the Earth all together.
nonapplause Laura and I are thrilled to be here at the Army Medical Center.
nonapplause I would just offer two friendly warnings.
nonapplause That's why we created the “Chefs Move to Schools” program  to pair chefs like you with interested schools in your local communities.
nonapplause We pay down $2 trillion debt over a 10-year period of time in our budget.
nonapplause We set a goal of starting or speeding up the cleanup work at 20 Superfund sites.
nonapplause In the case of Saddam Hussein  his hostility to our country long predates 9/11  and America's war on terror.
nonapplause And I'm in awe of the military families that I meet: spouses who play the role of both parents  trying to juggle getting to baseball games and ballet recitals  doing it all; grandparents who step in to care for the children when a single mom or dad in uniform is away; people who find the strength to carry on after those they love most have made the ultimate sacrifice.
nonapplause And within Iran  there's great potential for the Iranian people to forge greater prosperity through deeper integration with the international community  including with the United States.
nonapplause Their loss has moved a nation to action  in a cause to defend other innocent lives across the world.
nonapplause Ludwig Von Mises  that great economist  once noted: “People must fight for something they want to achieve  not simply reject an evil.” Well  the conservative movement remains in the ascendancy because we have a bold  forward-looking agenda.
nonapplause I had the honor to sit and visit with him for awhile about this  and let me just say a word or two about it.
nonapplause And what kinds of messages are your advertisements sending?
nonapplause But we should be able to hold and develop the place that we used to have before the rise of the Empire—a place once described as that of "the smallest of the great powers and the greatest of the small."
nonapplause We are grateful for your witness and your work on so many of the most fundamental issues.
nonapplause That's 16 -- not 16 -- but that's a thousand billion dollars.
nonapplause Our sense of economic community must promote well-governed societies.
nonapplause Yet trade promotion authority was allowed to lapse nearly a decade ago.
nonapplause This program means that in addition to my grandma and grandpa  I get to spend time with a wonderful guy like Ben  who is on stage here today.
nonapplause But it's of course the errors of the USA Patriot Act.
nonapplause Here at home  we will continue building prosperity that reaches every corner of the land so that every child born in America has a chance to learn  to succeed  and to rise in the world.
nonapplause We're also taking bold steps to open new markets and to make the global economy work for our people.
nonapplause I don't think there is any kind of thing you can't do.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause There are lots of things that are better.
nonapplause Many of you know better than me that our economy is slowing down.
nonapplause It's a pitiful sight.
nonapplause A series of steps that we've taken to strengthen our defenses  to protect our airline travelers  to improve our border security and so forth.
nonapplause You must first ask their permission  seek their approval  and then you can act on their behalf.
nonapplause I don't know if they talk at home  but they were all talking here.
nonapplause There is no substitute for the raw courage of the firefighter.
nonapplause But that's the good news -- because if we make the decisions  then we can decide to solve this problem.
nonapplause So there is a way to have a tax cut here and have the money to pay for the Medicare prescription drug program  to lengthen the life of Medicare and Social Security  to invest in the education of our children.
nonapplause I have sat in on so many of his speeches and he sat in on so many of mine -- I was sort of getting used to getting back to our old routine.
nonapplause 1991  Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
nonapplause And I want you to know that when my husband and I return to California I'm not giving up my interest and concern about this.
nonapplause I think first you must raise those issues that raise the standard of America's moral judgment.
nonapplause That's what I believe we should be doing.
nonapplause Still more significant  Congress would be required to state what they expect the impact to be on State and local governments and where the funds would come from  not leave it to local officials like you to explain to your constituents why you're forced to raise taxes because of something that happened in Washington.
nonapplause A priority is going to be pay down debt.
nonapplause The Prime Minister and I were talking about how to help Iraq become a democracy  understanding that a democracy in the heart of the Middle East will defy the terrorists' ambitions for spreading a totalitarian regime; that democracy is the only system that allows people to have hope for the long run  and that helps defeat resentment and the bitterness that they use to recruit their suiciders.
nonapplause If you go around telling people to be responsible all the time and there never is an opportunity coming forward  pretty soon they get tired of being responsible.
nonapplause Now  I will tell you that Social Security disability has gone up significantly during this recession.
nonapplause Britain produces only 3 per cent of greenhouse gases and this fraction will fall as less-developed countries advance economically.
nonapplause America is standing tall again  and don't let anyone tell you we're any less dedicated to peace because we want a strong America.
nonapplause But for small business people and farmers and a lot of individuals  health insurance has not gone down.
nonapplause If America could bring down inflation from 12.4 percent to 4  then we can bring inflation now down from 4 to 0.0.
nonapplause We thank them  and we thank God that our country is a place where people like them can flourish.
nonapplause And when we leave here  we'll be in Florida.
nonapplause Got to vote for the lesser of evils."
nonapplause And that's what we have here.
nonapplause And it reminded me that in 1862 Abe Lincoln gave us some enduring advice.
nonapplause They were treated with the dignity and respect to which they were entitled.
nonapplause I mean  how many elections have we had like that?
nonapplause After I became President  I went back and read all the founding documents again  to make sure that I knew them as nearly by heart as I could.
nonapplause Too bad  you're on your own.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at Florida Presidential Dinner
nonapplause Every American who pays federal income taxes -- including nearly 2 million here in Missouri -- benefited from the Bush tax cuts -- and so has our economy.
nonapplause So if the question is what are we going to do with the good times  and the answer is take on the big challenges and the big opportunities  then the issue is how.
nonapplause Commander Feldman  Madam President  former commanders of the VFW behind me  and vice commanders who escorted us into this hall  members of the VFW  members of the auxiliary and your guests:
nonapplause Certain experiences bind veterans from every branch of the service.
nonapplause The crime rate in this country's at a 26-year low  juvenile crime is going down  the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Education show that overall violence has actually decreased in our schools.
nonapplause Under his leadership  and with some help from his friends in this administration  it's going to be comeback time for Texas.
nonapplause I want you to be positively ecstatic at the prospect of bringing your own children into the world and this country and thinking about the 21st century being the most peaceful and prosperous and exciting time the world has ever known.
nonapplause When I was 21 years old it was the end of the civil rights movement.
nonapplause Also  a couple more announcements  please.
nonapplause It is a house divided: divided on principle  divided on policy  divided not once but many times over.
nonapplause From the first hour  we've known that the war on terror would be long and difficult.
nonapplause This is an election of massive consequence in every single policy area you can think of.
nonapplause You've worked so hard  and again the President and I -- and he is fully aware that I am here.
nonapplause That presumably makes a summer election more difficult  though not impossible.
nonapplause I also want to salute this organization and this team for donating so much time and energy to lifting up the Detroit community.
nonapplause It has been blocked in the Senate.
nonapplause We also considered the disturbing and increasing threat to public health in all our countries from AIDS.
nonapplause Every day you went about your jobs with tremendous focus and skill  regardless of the conditions -- and I know the desert over there can make a Georgia summer look pretty mild.
nonapplause And the doctor used all of his skills and one of those instruments they call a defibrillator and they eventually brought this person back to life  restarted his heart.
nonapplause And if you need a break  it will be arranged —- up to 30 days of respite care each year.
nonapplause We are supporting cities like New Orleans and many others that have curfew policies that have led to dramatic drops in the juvenile crime rate  to do so in a way that  at least based on anything that we can find through the Justice Department  is likely to be most effective and most positive.
nonapplause I want to say I came for two reasons.
nonapplause Combat units leave bottles of beer or stamp cigarettes into the ground as a salute to those they rode in battle with.
nonapplause Reaganomics.
nonapplause Immigrants from Asia and the Pacific helped build our country.
nonapplause But Congress should also urge the president to make every effort to obtain a fresh demand from the Security Council for prompt  unconditional compliance by Iraq within a definite period of time.
nonapplause We can never agree to any concessions that would recognize Soviet domination.
nonapplause And for the first time -- and this is the thing that shocked me -- in this history of our nation  medical experts have warned that our youngest generation may be on track to have a shorter life span than their parents as a direct result from obesity.
nonapplause They operate across borders  so we have got to strengthen our cooperation across borders.
nonapplause We at Swarthmore College  thanks to the support of the Center for American Progress  have created the Genocide Intervention Fund.
nonapplause We have to have a policy of institutional cooperation.
nonapplause It's not just the regulations being issued; it's the significant incentives.
nonapplause The first is that  for the first time in history more than half the people of the world live under governments they voted in.
nonapplause The welfare reform bill has been in the Congress since last March.
nonapplause Well  it's time to go now  but before leaving -- --
nonapplause And they have used those resources to fuel more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth.
nonapplause Those years of the Labour locust are coming to an end.
nonapplause Or as one of our more lively daily papers put it: "The Europeans are no longer cut off from merrie England."
nonapplause Asked the question: Should the United States aid the rebels to prevent Communist influence from spreading to other countries in Central America?
nonapplause Workers are changing jobs often during their lifetime.
nonapplause We will do so again this year  and keep it on a downward trend in the future.
nonapplause I'm so honored to see MMAC would host this reception -- or this conversation.
nonapplause Last March  the President and I rolled up our sleeves and worked alongside 20 000 other volunteers in California to hook up one-fifth of California's schools to the Information Superhighway in a single day.
nonapplause That will only reinforce and even deepen the political divides in this country.
nonapplause And it's a reminder that however important deeds may be  the things of the spirit come first.
nonapplause We think that needs to be done.
nonapplause If local governments and States can establish enterprise zones to create economic growth  then we can elect people like those I've mentioned earlier to Congress to help free our enterprise zones bill  a national bill  which has been buried in committee now in the House of Representatives by Tip O'Neill for more than 2 years.
nonapplause Blackmun actually claimed that he found nothing in the Constitution that protected the life of that child in the womb -- that established that that child must be treated as a person.
nonapplause My opponent said that if we decontrolled oil prices  it would cost the American consumers more than $36 billion a year.
nonapplause We all have a role in this.
nonapplause Other community development financial institutions will also be required to match assistance as well.
nonapplause This is not some casual passing thing.
nonapplause I was walking through this corridor to go to a big fundraiser full of people who wondered why they had bought tickets.
nonapplause We should go to war  we should use military power  we should do whatever we have to do.
nonapplause The President and I have a good feeling about this area  indeed  about the entire state because with your help  we're going to carry New Mexico on Tuesday.
nonapplause We worked to remove some more export barriers.
nonapplause This is another moment when American patriotism demands more dissent  less complacency in the face of stubborn pride from those in power.
nonapplause Forgive me -- I have to mention my name in it -- but I'm quoting Mark Helprin who said -- and remember this is from him now  not me.
nonapplause With your continued help and dedication and our renewed commitment  we can and will restore America's ability to educate all our children to the highest standards we know.
nonapplause It's the same insistence that led a band of patriots to overthrow an empire.
nonapplause We've known about this for decades  but despite the best efforts and good progress made by so many leaders and advocates with us today  the tobacco industry and its special interest lobbying have generally won the day up on the Hill.
nonapplause That didn't seem to make sense to me; it certainly wasn't fair.
nonapplause This has already been mentioned by the previous leaders  but I want to say I think it's imperative that the Democratic Party work in this Congress to actually pass -- and there are members of the Republican Party who want to do this with us.
nonapplause Eight million jobs had still been lost.
nonapplause That's a pretty good credo for all the rest of us  as well.
nonapplause In particular  I wanted to thank you for working closely with us this last year while I've been President of the mayor's group.

nonapplause As we meet today  in this ancient city of Canterbury  in the very heart of the region of Britain most directly affected by the Link  I should like to address a few words to the people of Kent.
nonapplause How will posterity reconcile these facts with the clear evidence that too many of our schools are teaching less?
nonapplause If you will look at this program you will see it is no accident why the interest rates are down  the jobs are up  and investment is coming back into America.
nonapplause Now  just days ago we learned that the figure that represents the country's economic growth  the gross national product  GNP  and some other indicators show our economy as gathering momentum for even more growth  higher take-home pay  and more new jobs.
nonapplause That's what we're really here to discuss  isn't it?
nonapplause Contrary to propaganda  the opponents of the Sandinistas are not diehard supporters of the previous Somoza regime.
nonapplause Same thing is true in the social area.
nonapplause To keep their promises  they would have to cut everything else that you depend upon by 20 percent across the board -- Social Security  $2 000 a person a year  Medicare  veterans programs  programs for farmers in the heartland of America  everything.
nonapplause Don't let anybody tell you what a handful of people does doesn't matter -- remember the last election?
nonapplause We encouraged them with our huge financial and military supplies to continue the war even after they had lost the will.
nonapplause So these are temporary jobs that are only going to last until the fall  and that may be reflected in future jobs reports.
nonapplause And my wife gave up a lot of that because she understood that it was important to carry on the work that we have been about this last eight years; and because half a dozen or more New York House members asked her to do it and she got up and spent her time -- she's been to every country in New York now and she fell in love with it and figured out that what they needed more was the same thing she had been working on for 30 years.
nonapplause You're making a decision.
nonapplause In my present job  I preside over a Senate whose membership includes Jay Rockefeller.
nonapplause Our liberal friends have spent the last 3 months trying to dress up their agenda in our clothes  but somehow nothing fits.
nonapplause You can say what you please.
nonapplause America is back because we discarded wrongheaded solutions that relied on big government  high taxes  and more Federal regulation.
nonapplause And they were crying  many of them with tears running down their cheeks.
nonapplause And to make sure all that of the best ideas in America are brought to bear.
nonapplause In the last several years our national security needs have required the Air Force to work with sister services in closer joint operations than ever before.
nonapplause Number one  we should fix Medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit.
nonapplause Can you help me with that?
nonapplause And then they came to a bridge.
nonapplause But I repeat today what I said in 1981: Our challenge is to move America forward and to make sure that nobody gets left behind.
nonapplause And retail sales are up  and industrial production is up.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause They see this country through your eyes as well -- through your good deeds.
nonapplause The Government of Nicaragua has imposed a new dictatorship.
nonapplause We must never surrender.
nonapplause Now  there's a reason why I'd like to make that deal with you.
nonapplause And what we favor -- it's much cheaper than their costs -- is letting the government  or having the government help lower income people have an additional IRA -- or I call it a USA savings account -- to invest however they want  to get into the market; but if they lose the money they'll still have the Social Security.
nonapplause And I have asked NASA and the Department of Defense to study the next generation of space transportation systems for use in the 1990's.
nonapplause Whatever the difficulties  we will remove them.
nonapplause I appreciate you  Senator Frist  for your commitment and strong comments.
nonapplause Hmm?
nonapplause And I want to thank each and every one of you for your very warm welcome.
nonapplause How long ago was it that you had to do all your quality checks visually and it took longer and not as well?
nonapplause We have to figure out how to make the most of this scientific and technological revolution.
nonapplause We must reject the use of terror  and recognize that Israel's security concerns are legitimate.
nonapplause Although we have been in the struggle against terrorism for nearly five years now  the terrorists were actually at war with us long before 2001.
nonapplause the extension of the lives of the parents into that future that  like the promised land to Moses  they will not live to know  but the hearts and minds and eyes of their children will carry them forward into that land.
nonapplause A couple of days ago I went to New Mexico to visit our national labs -- you may have seen the story.
nonapplause Our country has a special regard for Italy  and for the Italian people.
nonapplause And a lot of that just sounded like political rhetoric at the time.
nonapplause In fact -- listen to this -- throughout my lifetime homicide never made the top ten until 1989.
nonapplause He made his reputation as a leader in manufacturing -- and when Mac was in charge you'd have a quality product and you'd see black on the bottom line.
nonapplause As you take your place in the Navy and the Marine Corps  always bear in mind the heroism  the sacrifice  the leadership of those who have served before you.
nonapplause And our party had a pretty weak record in that period  I'm ashamed to say  and not so good in the years just before.
nonapplause Mrs Thatcher's total unanimity with the views of the Members  who proposed radical measures  was actually announced by my honourable colleague  Sir Henry Plumb himself.
nonapplause I mean  look at Bosnia -- a tiny country where you'd think the people would want to be pulling together to try to make the most of their very  very ancient heritage.
nonapplause Our next element of our plan  in this sort of three-legged stool here  is that we believed that it was necessary  although it is the most politically painful part of the process  and that is -- that is restoring our financial institutions.
nonapplause And look at France today.
nonapplause But what we-- The model we need to be thinking about is how to do we go from the state of disequilibrium from an interdependence to a community  where we have shared responsibilities and shared benefits based on shared values  simple shared values?
nonapplause When they weren't  he'd pull it back.
nonapplause Last month -- --
nonapplause How can it be sensible to flout everything history teaches us and all that we have learned from our own experience?
nonapplause The difference in 11 percent and 16 percent is $700 billion a year.
nonapplause But every human being needs something to say yes to  and too many of our children have not had enough things to say yes to.
nonapplause Creating opportunity  as Michigan understands  as well as anywhere  means creating good-paying jobs.
nonapplause And when a prince finally believed her  that's exactly what she did.
nonapplause A lot of you had to work your way through school.
nonapplause There will never be an incentive not to borrow money for college now  because you can get it if you need it at a lower interest rate  and you can pay it back as a percentage of your income no matter how much you borrow.
nonapplause In the months to come  inspectors will assist Libya in dismantling its entire WMD programs and its longer-range missiles.
nonapplause Our liberal friends just never seem to learn: You can't be for big government  big taxes  and big bureaucracy and still be for the little guy.
nonapplause But absent our leadership  it will continue to careen down the path we're going now.
nonapplause We're moving in the right direction.
nonapplause The American people will cast their ballots based not on what we did yesterday  but on what we will do tomorrow.
nonapplause But under this amendment the Federal Government could not forbid voluntary vocal prayer in our schools.
nonapplause And we will support the War Crimes Tribunal for as long as it is needed to do its work  until the truth is clear and justice is rendered.
nonapplause It's not that we don't like Senator Byrd's fiddling  mind you.
nonapplause Let us therefore continue our triumphant march   Uh huh   to the realization of the American dream.
nonapplause He thought he'd give them a little speech and looked for something in the nature of a platform.
nonapplause Someone once wrote that whether the angels play only Bach while praising God  we can't be sure  but we do know that when they play for themselves  they play Mozart.
nonapplause And the power and attraction of our example is evident in the unprecedented ferment we are now witnessing in Eastern Europe.
nonapplause I think it would have been better if he had said  "I do not have full control of our borders; my administration does not have it; the federal government  under my leadership does not have it."
nonapplause Today we free the land  so that they will remain unspoiled by bulldozers  undisturbed by chain saws and untouched for our children.
nonapplause It's not the first time that he had heard somebody say  well  we'll work together to see if we can't get enough money  and I suspect he might have thought  well  he's just trying to get me out of the Oval Office.
nonapplause So  let's go forth then  you and I  to tell the American people what is really at stake: the fate of generations to come  a hopeful vision of a world of freedom and a bountiful future of reverence and peace for our children and the children of all the world.
nonapplause And in devoting his talents to another distinctly American marvel  the movies  Fred Astaire added immeasurably to our heritage  to our sense of ourselves.
nonapplause Hey!
nonapplause We're here to lift the capacity of people at the entry level of America to actually make it.
nonapplause More than ever before in human history  our people's safety depends today on the security of people everywhere.
nonapplause We've removed two dictatorships that sponsored terror; liberated 50 million people from tyranny; and stood by young democracies as America always does.
nonapplause Now  here's the good news -- student performance is going up.
nonapplause And it's slowly beginning to sink in to more and more people out there.
nonapplause And according to them  our economic crisis emerged full-blown by spontaneous generation just a few seconds after I took the oath of office.
nonapplause Now  do you believe we're the ones that are on your side?
nonapplause There's no one in America that says  I've got a vested interest in keeping more mothers on welfare; I've got vested interest in keeping our schools substandard.
nonapplause My remaining time in office  I look forward to working with AJC leaders.
nonapplause There is a sense of possibility of movement  that those of us in public service are part of a partnership to make America what it ought to be as we move into the 21st century.
nonapplause We want to dash the false expectations that certain children can't learn to read.
nonapplause The terrorists will continue their missions of murder and suicide until they're stopped  and we will stop them.
nonapplause But it's an honor to be here with your outstanding Senator Bob Kasten and your superb Members of the Congress  Tom Petri and Toby Roth.
nonapplause And thanks to that example -- an example set by the Crew and by players across MLS and women's professional soccer  as well -- I'm confident that American soccer will remain something to be excited about for years to come.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause And we have to be willing to take tough decisions.
nonapplause We've got to continue constantly to root out any of the influences that weaken the moral and spiritual strength of this country.
nonapplause Now  you would think in the aftermath of that  that anybody sensible would say  you know what  we need to have some stronger rules of the road in place  not to stifle innovation  not to strangle the free market  but rather to make sure that everybody is playing by some basic rules; that financial institutions are making their money by providing good products and good services to their customers  instead of trying to game the system.
nonapplause We really do have the right to live in dignity.
nonapplause In 2000  we adopted America's share of the Global Debt Relief Initiative  which the Pope and Bono and Jessie Helms were for.
nonapplause Drug use among adults  people over 18  going down dramatically; drug use among people under 18 going up.
nonapplause And there is so much more than our party at stake.
nonapplause Our communities  our businesses  they're going to have to pitch in and do more.
nonapplause That does not sound like the right balance to me  and we need to start changing that misallocation of time and effort.
nonapplause Scott Naugle -- he's with us today.
nonapplause You will decide by whether you vote.
nonapplause That is good news.
nonapplause They're difficult  and they're very demanding.
nonapplause So we can't let that happen again.
nonapplause You remember me -- President Bush referred to me as the governor of a small southern state.
nonapplause A young boy is looking up at his father  and he says  "Daddy  when I grow up  I want to be a former president."
nonapplause We know that all opportunity starts with education.
nonapplause We know there will be some.
nonapplause America has been protected not by luck but by sensible policy decisions  by decisive action at home and abroad  and by round-the-clock efforts on the part of people in law enforcement  intelligence  the military  and homeland security.
nonapplause Third  farmers should have more to say about the kind of programs best suited to their way of life.
nonapplause A power over someone's resources is a power over his will.
nonapplause As a matter of fact  it said that these vampires  the vampire devices use about 4 percent of the electricity in the average home.
nonapplause And again  the same sustained  loud applause; and again  he sang "Vesti la giubba."
nonapplause What could be more important than health care for our older citizens and for ourselves?
nonapplause Let me also say that our administration is particularly concerned with the epidemic of teenage pregnancy.
nonapplause But more importantly and something that we focused on a lot  now that it's summer time  is that we need to substantially increase the amount of physical activity that our kids are getting not just in school but outside of school  as well  and that's why I am very excited about the launch of this program  “Let's Move Outside.” Very clever  right?
nonapplause That doesn't make sense  does it?
nonapplause Let me just go through each of these in turn.
nonapplause And if we could affect a peaceful transition in both those places that have greater trade at its core  and greater communications back and forth  the world would be a very different place in the next 50 years and a much better place for all of our children.
nonapplause Catch this  as a result of these efforts  in the past school year  every district closed after Katrina was reopened.
nonapplause And you have to indulge me  because I know that I'm sort of preaching to the saved here today.
nonapplause There's a huge consequence here.
nonapplause But our role reaches beyond this.
nonapplause He added  and this has an ironically prophetic tone today  "We have succeeded in healing the human heart by unblocking it  by bypassing it  even transplanting it  but we have failed to erase hate from it."
nonapplause It was a long way for the 101st from Normandy to final victory over fascism in Europe.
nonapplause But in the end  it is not weapons which cause war  but the people who possess them.
nonapplause And so  what is our answer?
nonapplause Webb can't be with us here tonight  because he's up there with my friend Billy Mounger  having a fundraiser up in Jackson -- carry on so he can be back there again in the Congress.
nonapplause If you think about that  every single one of those tasks requires that we do a better job of educating more of our people -- every single one.
nonapplause If they do anything else  then they have destroyed the law by destroying the constitutional basis for law in our society.
nonapplause That's why it's so important that we help small business struggling to stay open  or struggling to open in the first place  during these difficult times.
nonapplause And finally  there is no more important initiative than the faith-based program that I've submitted to the United States Congress.
nonapplause It means that the God of the Declaration  the God of the scriptures  is a God of liberty  a God of choice meant to see in His creation not just the slavish subjects of His will  but those who are endowed with the capacity -- through understanding that He shares with them -- freely to choose and  therefore  lovingly to submit to the will of their Creator  God.
nonapplause For four decades  the Council of the Americas has been committed to democracy and prosperity in the Western Hemisphere and through your tireless efforts this vision is becoming a reality across the hemisphere.
nonapplause You report the news as it happens  and you're covering history as it's made.
nonapplause It was during the campaign in the year 2000  when then-Governor Bush of Texas called to ask if I would help him find a running mate to be his Vice President.
nonapplause I know Mr. Khrushchev.
nonapplause It is the road to economic strength  and that strength is essential if we are to survive in this struggle in which we are engaged.
nonapplause This is a huge deal that is in this budget.
nonapplause So you think about those things  and think about them today  tomorrow and through November of 1998  and send her back to the Senate so we can send America forward.
nonapplause In the years ahead  more personnel will be stationed here  all with the job of maintaining a first-rate  forward operating base.
nonapplause Well  what then are we to make of the Soviet Union?
nonapplause It helps the special interests that the Government spends a great deal of money without Congress ever casting a vote.
nonapplause And once that ability is lost  democracy itself is threatened and we do become a government of men and not laws.
nonapplause And I am prepared to do my part to rectify that omission.
nonapplause I appreciate my Commerce Secretary  Donny Evans  for being here.
nonapplause It's something that makes  again  our town special.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the People of the Chillicothe Area
nonapplause We hope that you can join us this year because we need you  we want your help  and we know that we can do the things we're trying to do in a bipartisan way  together  as Americans  not just members of one party or the other.
nonapplause The interesting thing as I look out at this crowd of you -- and I see so many of you whom I've known for so many years  I think of all the struggles that you have been in with an uncertain result  determined to make life better for people in any number of ways.
nonapplause I said  David  if this is real  will it matter to the people that are just walking around on the street?
nonapplause I want to welcome all the doctors who gave joined us today at the White House.
nonapplause Tell them that education must never become a political football  because your children come first and they must come first.
nonapplause Well  I know and I cannot only speak for myself but for these gentlemen here on the platform  and that is  we're going to protect that tax cut  and you're going to continue to get the other installments that are still due.
nonapplause In other words  when there is a need  when our commanders on the ground say to our respective countries  we need additional help  our NATO countries must provide it in order to be successful in this mission.
nonapplause First  it's widely recognized that the basic values that we spoke about in the last campaign and long before that are values identified closely with Americans of Hispanic descent.
nonapplause And that's what today is all about.
nonapplause But you weren't watching the TV.
nonapplause I felt that same spirit when I had the privilege of being in Lillehammer and cheering for some of the athletes here on this stage  and knowing that they were representing the best of what our country has to offer.
nonapplause My friends  you get a sense of history when you travel  as Pat and I have  around the world.
nonapplause Or  if you put it in another way -- if you go back and read the Declaration of Independence  it basically lays out the things that our country has been for all along.
nonapplause That's not the way it works.
nonapplause He says he cares about the middle class.
nonapplause But also  helping to improve conditions in the surrounding neighborhood is a very important supplementary task  and Holland and Knight has understood that.
nonapplause Tres bon.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause Within two or three years  this district that was on the verge of failure and all these poor children on the verge of being denied the American Dream  had attendance rates and graduation rates and  most important of all  test scores above the state average in one of the wealthiest states in this country.
nonapplause And I have seen the brother and sister of James Byrd who was dragged to death in Texas because he was black.
nonapplause Within a week  when the announcement is made of the winners of the COPS FAST program  that total will be close to 15 000 -- well on the way to the 100 000 goal of the crime bill.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause You know it's a funny thing.
nonapplause They think we should put that back to the market alone.
nonapplause We Republicans are the hope for all those who seek expanded opportunity.
nonapplause This year  the balanced budget proposal I presented to Congress continues to help working families with new tax cuts to make child care more affordable  our economy stronger  and our environment cleaner by meeting the challenge of climate change.
nonapplause And this lady comes up to me - we were all standing around this circle  we were going to say a prayer -- and she puts her arm around me and she said  well  I'm a Republican  Mr. President  but I think I'll stand here with you anyway.
nonapplause We can't afford to waste anything.
nonapplause I had wholesale comic book business.
nonapplause And I want to tell you this story because it was told on me  but it's something every New Yorker ought to think about before this election.
nonapplause Why should we jump in the tank?
nonapplause In 1960  John Kennedy  the late John Kennedy  beat Richard Nixon by only 112 000 votes - less than one vote per precinct.
nonapplause Jeff understands that America faces challenges too important to be reduced to just politics.
nonapplause You never read about that in the questions about why we can't resolve some of the problems there.
nonapplause So  it hasn't been easy.
nonapplause All the small business people in this audience  it means higher interest rates for them.
nonapplause This initiative represents the largest investment in protecting our green and open spaces since President Theodore Roosevelt set our nation on this path nearly a century ago.
nonapplause But a whole lot of it  as you well know  because of the way we have financed health care  which has employed hundreds of thousands of people in doctor's offices  in clinics  in hospitals  and in insurance companies to read the fine print on thousands and thousands of policies to see who and what is not covered.
nonapplause Documents and equipment hidden in scientists' home that would have been useful in resuming uranium enrichment by centrifuge and electromagnetic isotope separation.
nonapplause I'm here to talk about the mechanism that's being used to achieve these changes  because that's what's most disturbing.
nonapplause And today  it's an honor to welcome the first-ever champions of the Women's Professional Soccer league to the White House.
nonapplause All of you are part of a team that continues to make history  removing threats to the United States and other free nations  and bringing new hope to a troubled region of the world.
nonapplause The idea started when Hancock Bank set up a shop in an RV.
nonapplause You've demanded that government live within its means.
nonapplause They're dirt cheap to insure  so we might as well do that and make sure that everybody under 22 has health insurance.
nonapplause Though we human beings speak different languages  come from different cultures  and hail from different lands  we share the same fundamental aspirations for freedom and equality  for truth and justice and beauty.
nonapplause At least the folks back in Massachusetts knew he was on the job.
nonapplause Prior to 9/11  most of the world was willing to look the other way when we found terrorists states  states or governments that allowed terrorists to operate from their territory.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to National Conference of State Legislatures
nonapplause And that's why I say to young people  you have to decide what you believe and take sides and stand up.
nonapplause Send him with that help that he's going to need.
nonapplause A leader in tax reform  jobs  and education  and a tough fighter in the war against crime -- a man who shares with the American people a vision of the future that is as big and hopeful and full of heart as this great country of ours -- Jim Thompson's my kind of Governor  and I'm sure he's yours.
nonapplause All of them rely on their businesses to support their families.
nonapplause And I know on behalf of the President and myself  we greatly appreciate it.
nonapplause We began a very serious effort to restrain nuclear materials in 1991  before I became President  a bipartisan effort sponsored by Senator Nunn and Senator Luger.
nonapplause Within weeks of 9/11  American forces were on the ground here  teaming up with Afghan freedom fighters to destroy the camps where terrorists trained to kill Americans and to take down the Taliban regime.
nonapplause Now  you look at this vast crowd today.
nonapplause That's the story of the separate struggles for independence that have made our nations who we are -- struggles that are forged on this continent  two adjoining nations founded on a set of shared values; that our democracy is not simply a gift from a previous generation  but a responsibility for each generation to protect and to pass on to the next.
nonapplause These last three-and-a-half years have brought some very serious challenges to our country.
nonapplause And just look at who you'll be working for up here in these stands  these young people.
nonapplause Every day  the one in three adults -- one in three young adults who don't have health insurance live one accident or one illness away from bankruptcy.
nonapplause I am most proud to serve a President and a Vice President that never let you forget that increasing the number of those American family success stories is why we are here and the guiding light for everything we do.
nonapplause We  in fact  had more diplomatic posts in the world than we have today  and foreign investment actually played a larger role in our own economy then than it does today.
nonapplause The next item on our agenda -- and nothing we've done in the last 6\1/2\ years has been more important -- is the survival of freedom in Central America.
nonapplause Stan was the state party chair at the time  and he took care of the financial end -- setting me up with a stipend of $300 for 40 days work.
nonapplause Let me tell you  if you don't know what it is  fast track is simple.
nonapplause More Americans are proud to be back on the job  thanks to our growing economy.
nonapplause Now's our chance and we ought to take it.
nonapplause Now  if somebody wants to defend that  they can.
nonapplause And we will get him eventually  I'm convinced.
nonapplause When the league was founded  Theodore Roosevelt said  "There are many ways in which a man or a woman can work for the higher life of American cities."
nonapplause Our opponents have a very different vision for our country.
nonapplause The true story of that first meeting is that I flunked my first interview  that I'd arrived in Washington as a young congressional Fellow  going to spend a year on the Hill working on a PhD dissertation  and then I was to go back to the University of Wisconsin and teach.
nonapplause China joined the World Trade Organization.
nonapplause I appreciate that very much  and I appreciate being introduced by Elaine Chao.
nonapplause Millions went to the polls  after we helped liberate that country from the Taliban.
nonapplause Over a 10-year period  we want to see all of our major trading partners opening the borders  tearing down barriers  and ending the export subsidies for agricultural goods.
nonapplause I want to tell you I'm very happy to have a few moments to share some thoughts with you at a time when I think we all recognize that the Republican Party  here and around the country  is in a critical moment and I think also  if we're not careful  may end up in a critical condition.
nonapplause And that regime is no more.
nonapplause People take a pessimistic view about how to project revenues  and that's fine.
nonapplause That's the way America is supposed to work.
nonapplause We are moving into a period of danger and hazard and opportunity.
nonapplause In any case today is the day when Parliament renews acquaintance with the European Council.
nonapplause I look across this country  I look across this audience  I see people of every race and creed and color and background that have gathered here from all parts of the world.
nonapplause The recovery plan also includes a series of tax cuts for small businesses and tax incentives to encourage investments in small businesses.
nonapplause We've got a lot more to do  but we're moving in the right direction  and I'm grateful for that.
nonapplause What you do impacts just about every moment of our lives -- from the words we read  to the public spaces we enjoy  to the devices that help us do our jobs and run our homes and care for our families.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause First of all  look at us.
nonapplause I won't be on the ballot in 2000.
nonapplause The judge asked him if he was prejudiced against the defendant  and he said  'Oh  no  judge.
nonapplause We can and must do better.
nonapplause The checks have begun to roll; they're beginning to move  and the Governor and his staff are on top of it.
nonapplause A chorus of doom and gloom rose up from our opponents saying our best days were behind us and ringing down the curtain on America.
nonapplause There really is no place in America more appropriate to address a subject so central to our future than California.
nonapplause I want to recognize his service and that of the other veterans of the Congressional Black Caucus -- Congressmen Blackwell  Bishop  Clay  Conyers  Dellums  Dixon  Jefferson  Rush  Stokes  Scott  and Towns.
nonapplause A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black.
nonapplause Who knows what this country's next young people can bring to us in the next 50 years or even in the next five years?
nonapplause And they now are in a time in history where we actually are having an effect on the world that is historic and will have enormous impact on how the world looks for the next many decades.
nonapplause The people here today showcase just how crucial women are in guiding our families  and in our neighborhoods  and in our country  as well.
nonapplause Well  it is a thrill to be here.
nonapplause I've heard all this talk about how the Democratic Party is dead because we don't have any new ideas  or we're too liberal  or we're slaves to government.
nonapplause I know he's elsewhere on a very important engagement right now.
nonapplause But it is not just for them  because if you weaken Medicare too much  then people like you will have to spend more money on your parents and you'll have less money to send your kids to college.
nonapplause You really reached the hearts of people throughout the world.
nonapplause But the failures of the last decade should have taught us something.
nonapplause Almost instantly the amount of venture capital available in our country rose sharply  making it possible to expand existing companies and to form new ones  creating new jobs in the process.
nonapplause The progress we've seen in Iraq has not come easily  but it has been steady  and we can be confident going forward.
nonapplause when another life was saved.
nonapplause I was thinking about it today.
nonapplause If we can focus on cuts  not making partisan points  that's the first step.
nonapplause There's always the temptation to forget this  to carry ourselves with an air entitlement  as if good things come to us by right.
nonapplause Now we're making sure that people know about their new options under Medicare -- options like full drug coverage in 2006.
nonapplause Today  we move forward to try to make sure we do what we can to protect  in an important way  genetic privacy.
nonapplause Some people are saying that this whole Republican thing is over with  and all of that.
nonapplause To preserve places like this  we must bring to our work a new spirit of respect and cooperation  what I call a new environmentalism for the 21st century.
nonapplause First of all  in the moment.
nonapplause She's working hard trying to pay her rent  trying to feed her kids  but she just can't catch up.
nonapplause You were here 2 weeks ago  and you were selling those as Democrat puppies.
nonapplause The whole concept doesn't make any sense when you're talking about al Qaeda.

nonapplause You've also got to go on offense.
nonapplause And we see government as something belonging to the people and only a junior partner in our lives.
nonapplause For that reason  the Governor and officials across Florida provided early and decisive leadership in seaport security.
nonapplause And of those things that have happened  how many of us could have imagined 8 or even 4 years ago that one day a President of the United States would have an opportunity to stand  as I did a few months ago  there in the Lenin Hills  at a podium at Moscow State University  and tell the young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder and glory of human freedom?

nonapplause We're using government to provide the seed money to grow private industries.

nonapplause And I had a wonderful talk with his wife today  and it reminded me of why I have been a Democrat all my life.
nonapplause And I think that's very important.
nonapplause Issues of national security will clearly be at the top of the agenda in this election year.
nonapplause Secretary Cuomo's reinvented HUD exemplifies the kind of approach we're trying to take to working with the cities all across the federal government.
nonapplause And we came from different backgrounds  different beliefs  but we didn't care about that.
nonapplause See  when you have low standards  you're liable to get bad results.
nonapplause Since  as Paul Harvey said  George Washington started receiving the first one in 1776  Thomas Edison  Marian Anderson  Eli Weisel  Winston Churchill -- Billy and Ruth Graham belong in their company  and more.

nonapplause The Chinese State Visit and the change in the weather have taken a little of my voice away  so I've asked the Vice President to come with me and give the speech.

nonapplause The United States must not turn its back on the democratic aspirations of the people of Central America.

nonapplause Sometime back  he said the old days of a Soviet strategy of suppression by force are over.
nonapplause Let us march on ballot boxes    Let's march   march on ballot boxes until race-baiters disappear from the political arena.
nonapplause And up in the Congress  there are people who don't have to run the programs who say it can't be done.
nonapplause I thank you for being here  and for reminding us who were born too late or too far away to have met Winston Churchill that he is not quite lost in the mists of history  and is nearer than we think.
nonapplause So we're doing that.
nonapplause Ambassador to Mexico  Ambassador Pascual.
nonapplause Now it's about to become the first new nation of the 21st Century  a big thing for Asia to stop that.
nonapplause And this is where you come in.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the First Lady and Mrs. Medvedeva at Duke Ellington School for the Arts
nonapplause War and genocide haunted Central Africa.
nonapplause Not a day goes by that I do not express my thanks in my heart and to our God for the service you render.
nonapplause I've submitted a plan to Congress to close that gap.
nonapplause But it's always a warning sign when we're accused of disloyalty by presidents and their surrogates whose only goal is really to seek a safe harbor from the truth or from debate  from accountability.
nonapplause And he took me to a block that had been wiped out.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause In Laos where we have spent more money per capita than in any country in the world  they are moving from neutralism to hostility  and the reason is singlefold.
nonapplause President Bush and I are grateful to all of our friends in this part of the country  and very grateful to the sixth district for sending Sam Graves to Washington.
nonapplause And whether their service came abroad or at home  every veteran has shared the responsibility of keeping America strong.
nonapplause He had a hard decision to make  and he made it.
nonapplause We know that with all the problems we have and all the opportunities we have  we have to think anew about what the responsibilities of our government in Washington should be  what your responsibility should be here at the state level  and through you to the local level  and what should be done more by private citizens on their own with no involvement from the government.
nonapplause Cures for diabetes and heart disease -- and I have seen the evidence of some of the experiments already -- to know that there is hope for that -- that developments of cures up there that we cannot develop here on Earth.
nonapplause But we've taken important steps that were not taken before  and there's more to come.
nonapplause One of the big problems we've had all across the country is the cost of the malpractice insurance.
nonapplause Just the other day  a part-time chaplain at the New York State Prison near Buffalo was suspended from her job for expressing sympathy with Mr. bin Laden and other terrorists.
nonapplause But this argument simply does not hold any water.
nonapplause We're also committed to ensuring that America remains the world's leading innovator.
nonapplause If it was “pre ” I was getting it --   -- because I was looking for anything that was quick and easy to prepare and to consume.
nonapplause You represent the future of the American economy.
nonapplause And you know  I could tell that it was really working when they stopped calling it Reaganomics.
nonapplause First of all  let me say I agree with everything she said.
nonapplause Well  so this is not the moment to bring tax rates down to their lowest level in half a century.
nonapplause All I can tell you is I've been around a lot of people and I've never seen anybody that I thought had the gift for public service that she does.
nonapplause Anyway  right here at University of Texas on the island of Galveston.
nonapplause There is a more sensible approach  accept change and its many benefits  but recognize the disruptions this change brings forth and give people the tools to thrive and prosper.
nonapplause So let's be clear  it's not enough just to limit ads for foods that aren't healthy.
nonapplause I thank Secretary Perry for his efforts in that regard.
nonapplause On Wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted  which reflects our mutual desire for peace  freedom  and democracy in Nicaragua.
nonapplause More homes would have surely been lost.
nonapplause We had a balanced policy on crime.
nonapplause There I called on America to complete the work of the author of the Declaration of Independence with an Economic Bill of Rights that will restore to Americans the freedoms our Founding Fathers assumed we would always have and protect us and future generations from the encroachments of big government in our lives.
nonapplause Or to grasp at the ocean at a span
nonapplause The NIE cautioned that quote: "Since inspections ended in 1998  Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort  energized its missile program  and invested more heavily in biological weapons; in the view of most agencies  Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program."
nonapplause And these have created new and daunting problems.
nonapplause And this not an afterthought.
nonapplause In his view  opposing terrorism is far less of a military operation and far more of an intelligence-gathering  law enforcement operation.
nonapplause With the enemy advancing -- so close they could hear their voices -- he got on his radio and started calling in artillery.
nonapplause Now  these critical reserves of food would be stored at strategic locations throughout the Nation.
nonapplause These are people who want to be productive.
nonapplause But he said  I think it's beginning to work.
nonapplause In removing the terror regime from Iraq  we send a very clear message to all groups that operate by means of terror and violence against the innocent.
nonapplause A guy in the back said  yes  "If you weren't President  I'd be buying stocks right now."
nonapplause Some of us will do it a little more vocally  a little more loudly than others.
nonapplause the Tennessee Valley.
nonapplause And only with your help can America make the right choice -- to make sure that no one is left behind; to use these new technologies to widen the circle of opportunity rather than allowing the digital divide to widen the lines of division in education  race  income and region.
nonapplause In the center.
nonapplause Because for the first time since before the Civil War we brought the deficit down four years ago  and interest rates have been lower.
nonapplause These good docs who have got the great compassionate job of taking care of youngin's  they're getting run out of business because of frivolous and junk lawsuits.
nonapplause That's not my problem.
nonapplause I believe in the Direct Loan Program.
nonapplause They're playing a classic role  one that they undertook after World War II when they brought hope and help to the people of Europe and Japan.
nonapplause There are many other things that I have done  specific things that I am very proud of  but I think  generally  doing that has made a big difference.
nonapplause Now I found  of course  a number of very interesting things on this campaign tour so far.
nonapplause If we follow Congressman Murtha's advice and withdraw from Iraq the same way we withdrew from Beirut in 1983 or Mogadishu in 1993  we will simply validate the al Qaeda strategy and invite more terrorist attacks in the future.
nonapplause But alongside his Oscar-winning emotional audacity there's his versatility  from a coma patient in Awakenings  to an ever-possessive father in Meet The Parents.
nonapplause And he said that just before the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia.
nonapplause Well now  wait a minute.
nonapplause Believe me  not every member of the National Rifle Association is dead set against you.
nonapplause Jim  I want to thank you for your service to the country.
nonapplause The purpose of aid must be to create the conditions where it is no longer needed -- where we help build the capacity for transformational change in a society.
nonapplause Second  let's check our progress in attacking social problems  where important gains have been made  but which still need critical attention.
nonapplause One of -- I'm going to get E.J.
nonapplause As in Vietnam  we went into Iraq ostensibly to fight a larger global war under the misperception that the particular theater was just the latest battleground.
nonapplause Joe and Holly  America is grateful.
nonapplause Most recently  he's launched an assault on the capability and the competence of our troops and commanders in Iraq  charging that American forces did not do enough to protect a weapons facility in Iraq  with the result that some 300 plus tons of explosives disappeared.
nonapplause And let us come together  Christians and Jews  let us pray together  march  lobby  and mobilize every force we have  so that we can end the tragic taking of unborn children's lives.
nonapplause But you should be of good cheer  because for most of history  people have behaved as if the meaning of their lives came from positive association within their group  and negative reference to those who are outside of it.
nonapplause So I come this evening with an appeal--an appeal that I guess in some ways is a selfish reflection of my own situation  because try as I might this election year  I couldn't do this for myself in Maryland because I've got nobody to vote for.
nonapplause She had actually spent a lot of her life working in Atlanta at the grass roots with people with HIV and AIDS.
nonapplause If the Soviet Union destroyed one-half of our steel capacity  we would think we had been ruined.
nonapplause I tasted it.
nonapplause And the farmer said  "Yep."
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause And the ancient Hebrew was Tukun Allum -- Your mission is to repair the world.
nonapplause First of all  there was putting up with the shock of those who found out that you were going to try to do what you said you were going to try to do.
nonapplause What can we do to be worthy of such service and such sacrifice?
nonapplause Bill will make Alabama a great Congressman in the mold of Bill Dickinson and Sonny Callahan  and I hope you'll help him.
nonapplause But stout of heart  we see across the dangers the great future that lies beyond  and we rejoice."
nonapplause And I know many of you have  as well  too.
nonapplause And what's going to happen.
nonapplause Mel French  our protocol chief and  for many years  her deputy  David Pryor  Jr. And Marsha Scott  who has kept in touch with so many of you for me over these last eight years.
nonapplause Here's what he had to say earlier this week --   "You know education  if you make the most of it  you study hard  you do your homework  and you make an effort to be smart  you can do well.
nonapplause Now  there is no silver bullet when it comes to turning these schools around.
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen  there could be no more eloquent testimony to the character of our country than those words from an American who served in that war.
nonapplause This is a good thing.
nonapplause At a time when college is more important than ever  after you hopefully get out of high school -- and we've got many things we can do to help kids get out of high school -- too many Americans can't afford to go.
nonapplause Now  here's what happened.
nonapplause Fight for your future  and determine that we are going to do this together.
nonapplause Either way  you will look back on them as turning points.
nonapplause Do we have the right to elect?
nonapplause Both parties in both chambers of Congress have joined in this call.
nonapplause That's what our budget bill was all about  which lifted the working poor out of poverty when they have children at home.
nonapplause That  Mr. President  was an age when they really knew how to pay compliments!
nonapplause For those who did  we set up these  began to set up this network of second chance homes.
nonapplause Like many of my countrymen  I experienced the magic of Israel at a relatively young age -- at least it looks young now from my perspective.
nonapplause That is what I think.
nonapplause But what I want to emphasize is this: Even when we have differences  we cannot allow those differences to prevent us from making progress.
nonapplause And I have to say that if you honestly believe in your heart of hearts  in your conscience  that this is not an improvement over the status quo; if despite all the information that's out there that says that without serious reform efforts like this one people's premiums are going to double over the next five or 10 years  that folks are going to keep on getting letters from their insurance companies saying that their premium just went up 40 or 50 percent; if you think that somehow it's okay that we have millions of hardworking Americans who can't get health care and that it's all right  it's acceptable  in the wealthiest nation on Earth that there are children with chronic illnesses that can't get the care that they need -- if you think that the system is working for ordinary Americans rather than the insurance companies  then you should vote no on this bill.
nonapplause Why is it that we are not making that investment?
nonapplause You got to be strong for your family while your brother or sister is serving overseas  or you've got to look after younger siblings while your mom is working that second shift.
nonapplause The truth is  politics and morality are inseparable.
nonapplause I say it because I have seen America  and I have confidence that our people are ready for the challenge  to give the world the moral and spiritual leadership that it needs in these critical times  and that's more important than our military strength and our economic wealth combined.
nonapplause Now  these are simple  cost-effective steps -- ones which we've already taken  or at least are in the process of taking.
nonapplause And I would just like to talk to you about them.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause And I say to you today that to those who claim that America is second militarily  second economically  second in prestige  they don't know what they're talking about.
nonapplause And the best hope for lasting results is to look past the partisan divide and to find common ground.
nonapplause And more than 10 percent of women in this country are currently taking care of a sick or elderly relative  often a parent  and making critical health care decisions for them as well.
nonapplause The bids are coming in for health care from five to 40 percent below current costs.
nonapplause I feel like we're between two great possibilities: we're either going to turn things around  and in this generation see the rising sun of a new moral dedication in America  or we're going to lose the struggle for that moral renewal  throw away the basic principles on which our life and civilization is based  and head toward a new century that will make the 20th century look like a dress rehearsal for evil.
nonapplause So we're going to close the loopholes.
nonapplause Time and again  our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval.
nonapplause Dirk Van Dongen  who is my good buddy  who represents the National Association of Wholesaler Distributors.
nonapplause Look at only a portion of their spending wish-list  and you will be staggered.
nonapplause But do you know how we'll end it?
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at Luncheon for Congressman Michael Forbes
nonapplause I read a few  but one of them I will never forget.
nonapplause So you can remember that.
nonapplause We're in the second year of surpluses  with years and years more projected in the future.
nonapplause Now  a lot of states are acting in this area  too.
nonapplause And Janet's family is not alone.
nonapplause I need all the friends I can get.
nonapplause It could have something to do with the so-called angry white male phenomenon.
nonapplause That requires better intelligence  not less of it.
nonapplause The path to lower deficits is not paved with tax increases and unilateral disarmament.
nonapplause One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self-reliance  our rugged individualism  our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government.
nonapplause That's why  of the 30 fastest growing occupations in America  half require a Bachelor's degree or more.
nonapplause But we can give you all that money in Florida and you won't be able to take advantage of it.
nonapplause Educating our children is a priority  national defense is a priority.

nonapplause The realities are not going to change.
nonapplause People heading West.
nonapplause Entrepreneurship -- because you told us that this was an area where we can learn from each other; where America can share our experience as a society that empowers the inventor and the innovator; where men and women can take a chance on a dream -- taking an idea that starts around a kitchen table or in a garage  and turning it into a new business and even new industries that can change the world.
nonapplause When these same Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner -- were in charge  the number of earmarks and pet projects went up  not down.
nonapplause But I won't  because Senator Fritz Hollings  a Democrat  has already said that.
nonapplause They've got a different system.
nonapplause But to accomplish any of these goals  we have to revolutionize the government itself so that the American people trust the decisions that are made and trust us to do the work that government has to do.
nonapplause The no-fly zones have been and will remain an important part of our containment policy.
nonapplause And we all know that women -- empowered women are vital to our economic security.
nonapplause I thank you for being worthy of yourselves.
nonapplause And let me pause here and say that there is no change of which I'm prouder than that our young men and women once more take pride in wearing the uniform of the United States of America.
nonapplause There are going to be times where folks lose heart.
nonapplause One is that consumer confidence started going up in November and exploded in December  and it's going to be strong in January.
nonapplause So let me say that a precipitous American withdrawal from Iraq would be a disaster for the United States and the entire Middle East.
nonapplause The fact was -- it's a bit of a stretch  but you'll understand here in a minute.
nonapplause Science has set before us decisions of immense consequence.
nonapplause As she told you earlier  she's a lifelong educator  having spent 20 years in Ohio public school classrooms.
nonapplause If you live long enough and you stay in public life long enough and you take on enough issues and you make enough adversaries  you will have your bad days as well as your good ones.
nonapplause And already  46 states are working to develop such standards.
nonapplause I said a statistic the other day in the State of the Union that's got to startle you if you're involved with the health care delivery in America: 1 500 counties don't have an OB/GYN because lawsuits have driven a lot of good docs out of those counties.
nonapplause Her husband is and advertising art director.
nonapplause We've learned many lessons since September 11th  2001.
nonapplause were we directed from Washington when to sow and when to reap  we should soon want for bread."
nonapplause As you know  it is not for me to talk to you about the media or presentation because when it comes to presentation I am not really very good at it.
nonapplause The illegal weapons hidden by the former regime will be found.
nonapplause They seek to persecute women  and to oppress entire populations by spreading violence  fear  and putting dissenters to death.
nonapplause Now  they're doing it in salami tactics so you don't know this.
nonapplause In 1957 we had more people stationed in West Germany in our embassies than in all of the embassies of Africa combined.
nonapplause Sir?
nonapplause Thank you for the warm welcome today  and thank you for joining me here this afternoon.
nonapplause And there's not a soul in here who hasn't done that.
nonapplause But there's one other thing that was on the agenda last year that the President said  look  we didn't do it last year  he pleaded with the Congress  do it this time.
nonapplause But perhaps the worst sin America ever committed about Africa was the sin of neglect and ignorance.
nonapplause Instead  ideas -- ideas of freedom -- will define 21st century Asia.
nonapplause But they want to repeal it because they're more interested in the next election than they are in the next generation.
nonapplause I think the Braves have shown us the best side of professional sports -- perseverance and hard work and commitment  and a commitment that has endured over seasons.
nonapplause The story of a child born far from home to parents guided only by faith  but who would ultimately spread a message that has endured for more than 2 000 years -– that no matter who we are or where we are from  we are each called to love one another as brother and sister.
nonapplause We shape the future.
nonapplause There will doubtless be more to be debated about.
nonapplause During 52 years  you have faithfully carried out your responsibility to do justice and have compassion.
nonapplause And it's better for us to face it today and to deal with it today when we've got friends and allies all over the world out there who are willing to work with us on it than it would be to postpone action and to wait.
nonapplause You find solutions that we never thought of.
nonapplause We want to take those same basic concepts and principles of testing and standards and accountability and apply it to high schools across the country.
nonapplause And  ladies and gentlemen  I think we Republicans had a right to the support that we got.
nonapplause To me  however  what stands out about Lady Thatcher's career is that she has always been true to England -- to the values  the traditions and ideas that have enabled her small island to play such a huge role in human events.
nonapplause In a memmrial prinped in the ship's paper  they wrote: “We bid farewell to a Christian soldier  a gentleman  shipmate  and friend.
nonapplause This plan will continue to save and create more jobs over the next two years -- just like it was designed to do.
nonapplause And what we did  of course  was to decide to do everything we could to harden the target here at home  to improve our defenses at home.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the First Lady at Brinkley Middle School  Jackson  MS
nonapplause If the whole system breaks down  as it did in the Great Depression  how do you get it back up?
nonapplause Support for human rights and human dignity is ingrained in America.
nonapplause First  on jobs  and then second  I'll come to education.
nonapplause But it's also important  if there are any lifestyle changes we can make to reduce the number of people that have mental  as well as physical disabilities  we have to do that.
nonapplause Well  it's wonderful to see your enthusiasm.
nonapplause The government agency that ranks number one on the small business hit list -- I said hit list -- is OSHA.
nonapplause We have to keep that idea in mind today.
nonapplause He told her of the many patients he sees leaving the hospital with prescriptions he knows they will never fill  because they can't afford it.
nonapplause It means the maximum national effort in which Government at all levels and also private enterprise must work closely together.
nonapplause Colleen  at 34  represents both youth and experience.
nonapplause It's all the more sobering that it hasn't changed all that much in a lot of rural America.

nonapplause Worn arguments are traded across entrenched divides.
nonapplause You are fighting to ensure that violence will not triumph.
nonapplause All you other Texans who are here  make sure you behave yourself.
nonapplause We must show that faith and traditional values are the things that give life human dignity  warmth  vitality  and yes  laughter and joy.
nonapplause Randy  of course  is exactly the kind of congressman we need in Washington -- a true man of the West  an independent thinker  a person of good  solid  common sense judgment.
nonapplause So that's what we do for the folks with health insurance.
nonapplause Now  can you see where they cycle's got us to?
nonapplause The measure of true compassion is results.
nonapplause I'd like to take just a couple of minutes this morning and say a little bit about the background in terms of how it is we got to where we are  and then comment on a couple of the things that we think are important going forward.
nonapplause We have a productive strength which is unequaled.
nonapplause We had in 1959 last year - in 1957  we had more of our foreign service personnel stationed in Western Germany than in all of Africa.
nonapplause Please forgive me for not trying to acknowledge all the dignitaries who are present but I just want to get right into this.
nonapplause May God keep you  and may we  all of us  keep God.

nonapplause But  seriously  it was a very good thing.
nonapplause If we were to leave this young democracy before the job is done  there would be chaos  and out of chaos would become vacuums  and into those power vacuums would flow extremists who would be emboldened; extremists who want to find safe haven.
nonapplause It's a realistic budget.
nonapplause Most schools just had one connection in the library or something.
nonapplause And the good news is that the Senate has already acted on this legislation.
nonapplause I'm proud to say -- on another subject -- that during these last 4 years  not 1 square inch of territory in the world has been lost to Communist aggression.
nonapplause The Japanese don't want to give up theirs.
nonapplause And I'm grateful to him for that.
nonapplause The gardener protested  saying it was a slow-growing tree and wouldn't mature for a hundred years.
nonapplause And of course  some people believe that governments should dominate human action and that individuals must live like sheep.
nonapplause We set aside $2.6 trillion of payroll taxes over the next 10 years for Social Security and for only Social Security.
nonapplause I called this your first concert in the United States  but that isn't quite accurate.
nonapplause But what I said was  you know  America is not a speed boat  it's an ocean liner.
nonapplause But it's a lesson long delayed and clearly not uniformly and consistently accepted by senior members of the Cabinet.
nonapplause There are global challenges and global opportunities.
nonapplause Ella lived courageously.
nonapplause Their big idea for the economy: to raise our taxes.
nonapplause We know that we live in a marvelous world  where the kids with a good education are going to be able to do things their parents could not even have imagined.
nonapplause You were saying that you've seen something happen to your revenues  but I couldn't hear you.
nonapplause They saw a need  they filled up a truck  and they started driving.
nonapplause Mondale says I don't do this.
nonapplause Their infant mortality rate has dropped by 50 percent.
nonapplause And if they were to do that and succeed in getting into the United States with that kind of capability  obviously  they would threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans  far more than we lost on 9/11.
nonapplause The speaker of the house  Mr. Hastert and I  jointly sponsored the plan Colombia in 2000  which provided funds to the Colombians to try to fight the narco-traffickers.
nonapplause She is a strong voice for responsible government  and you can be proud of the job that she's doing in Washington.
nonapplause We talk about how terrible it is and refuse to do anything about it.
nonapplause Every doctor he had said Ethan needed daily physical therapy so he could keep his freedom of movement.
nonapplause When Wall Street says war the press says war and the pulpit promptly follows with its Amen.
nonapplause And that's why I've said that as we emerge from this recession  we can't afford to return to the pre-crisis status quo.
nonapplause And we should do more.
nonapplause She's also been a strong supporter of the President's economic program -- tax cuts and child tax credit  and dividend and capital gains tax reduction  and the small business expensing increases that have been so important to New Mexico's economy.
nonapplause You did a good thing coming here and giving her money today.
nonapplause This year  when it served his purpose  he described himself as an opponent of the war.
nonapplause And so our counterterrorism operations are still going to be conducted jointly.
nonapplause So I came here to say  we can have more companies like yours.
nonapplause Now do you see  this is the way ... see it and it's best between the United States and the Soviet Union.
nonapplause And you make sure you thank your relatives on behalf of Senator Stevens and myself for doing such a fabulous job to defend freedom.
nonapplause You know  before I became President  John Koskinen was a personal friend of mine -- I doubt if he still is now that I got him to do this.
nonapplause But we are trying.
nonapplause The Republicans  then  were the party of high tariff.
nonapplause And that's why this administration supports the Healthy Families Act  which would let millions more working Americans earn up to seven days a year of paid sick time to care for themselves and their families.
nonapplause And it's important that we think about where other people are.
nonapplause No responsible President should rely solely on a piece of paper for his country's safety.
nonapplause The markets will benefit.
nonapplause We've been able to break up terror cells and prosecuted terrorist operatives and supporters in Texas  California  New Jersey  Illinois  Virginia  New York  Oregon  and Florida.
nonapplause That sounds nice  doesn't it?
nonapplause Thank you  everybody.
nonapplause So today we are taking a major step towards fulfilling this campaign promise.
nonapplause Now  for the benefit of these outlaw governments who are sponsoring international terrorism against our nation  I'm prepared to offer a brief lesson in American history.
nonapplause I think this is a very big problem here and a rather new one  compared to the old approach to social protection measures.
nonapplause Not only do the volunteers reap the personal rewards of working with children  they are also helping develop individuals who can very well become future colleagues.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a White House Briefing for Black Administration Appointees
nonapplause First  the bill will help us strengthen cooperation between India and United States on one of the most important challenges in the 21st century  and that is energy.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech at Values Voter Summit 2006
nonapplause The results: crippling inflation  interest rates which went above 20 percent  a national debt approaching a trillion dollars  nearly 8 million people out of work  and a steady 3-year decline in productivity.
nonapplause But that's not enough.
nonapplause When you put your shoulder behind  you got to lean into it.
nonapplause The second thing they learned was that they could hit us  and if they hit us hard enough  they could change our policies because it happened a couple of times.
nonapplause This is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history.
nonapplause Their slogan was brutal: "Vote today  die tonight."
nonapplause I went to a Rotary Club installation banquet.
nonapplause The people here are wonderful and friendly.
nonapplause ﻿  President Discusses Growing the Economy & Creating Jobs in State of the Union
nonapplause It has been difficult  we've overcome  I think  or at least partially overcome years and years of agencies figuring that they were doing it alone  that their own mission had nothing to do with any other agency mission.
nonapplause We have to make a special effort to bring current output and consumption more nearly into balance in that period.
nonapplause And that's why my administration has consistently implemented not just legislative strategies but also  where we have the power through executive orders  to make sure that those basic values are reflected.
nonapplause Again  people may not agree with some of the things that are happening  but for example  the other day I signed a Senate resolution to change the ergonomic rules.
nonapplause You have to use it  maybe  in war to kill as many human beings as you can.
nonapplause This was the sixth time out.
nonapplause You may remember what I said last summer: that we could compare the big spenders in Congress with a drunken sailor out on a spree -- but that would really be unfair to the sailor  because at least he's spending his own money.
nonapplause The problem with that approach is that unless everyone has access to affordable coverage  you can't prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions; you can't limit the amount families are forced to pay out of their own pockets.
nonapplause We don't know in Washington how to do that.
nonapplause But the Lord was looking over them.
nonapplause We finally have a bigger groups of kids in school -- which every Florida school district with a bunch of trailers out back of the regular building knows.
nonapplause But they won't be as much bigger.
nonapplause Third  in our budget we provide more funds for teacher training.
nonapplause Those are the only two sources of just and legitimate law in these United States.
nonapplause Broke  out of money  kaput  busted.
nonapplause First  we must come together on behalf of our common prosperity.
nonapplause I see some people who seem to have psyched the game out pretty well  because they know that the only way to win in a game like that it making people uncertain how you will vote.
nonapplause You know  I want Al Gore to be elected because I know him better than anybody in this room  and most people in the world.
nonapplause No  I don't know that  but I think it will be.
nonapplause We love our crowd but we don't love people who aren't in our crowd.
nonapplause And their idea for cheering up the country is to raise our taxes.
nonapplause But this watch doesn't protect someone's silverware; it protects something more valuable -- freedom.
nonapplause I saw my grandmother work her way up to become one of the first women bank vice presidents in the state of Hawaii  but I also saw how she hit a glass ceiling -- how men no more qualified than she was kept moving up the corporate ladder ahead of her.
nonapplause I don't think this is good enough.
nonapplause I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation.
nonapplause It was really good to us in the 1990s.
nonapplause In the West  Mr. President  we have a long familiarity with the pressures of change.
nonapplause But I also said there  and I would like to reiterate here  I believe there is a broad bipartisan consensus in this country to continue the work until we have eliminated this permanent deficit  until we are living within our means  until we are committed  all of us  in living on a balanced budget.
nonapplause It is imperative that you remain the best fighting force in the world.
nonapplause But it is also true that the science is extremely clear now  that warmer oceans make the average hurricane stronger  not only makes the winds stronger  but dramatically increases the moisture from the oceans evaporating into the storm - thus magnifying its destructive power - makes the duration  as well as the intensity of the hurricane  stronger.
nonapplause The more insecure we are  the more difficult it is for us to change because we're too busy just trying to survive.
nonapplause It's not just any longer the cities and the urban ghettos  but the suburbs and the rural areas--what used to be the wholesome heartland of America  now palled by violence  palled by drug abuse.
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen  we are at an historic moment in our country's history -- on the verge of a new century  living in a very different kind of economy with a bewildering way of challenges and opportunities.
nonapplause They hate all who reject their grim vision of tyranny.
nonapplause Franklin Roosevelt warned that fear can paralyze us.
nonapplause But I know that most folks are nowhere near as lucky as I was.
nonapplause I've worked real hard here on a program that would balance all the interests to save the Florida Everglades.
nonapplause It shall be our nation and all the nations inspired by the hope and truth we yet may bring and together we shall walk into the kingdom of God and know the true glory that is His gift of liberty.
nonapplause And  unless we let it go up to 17 per cent  we should not have got the money in to finance even the limited expenditure we're undertaking and we should never have been in a position to tackle inflation in eighteen months' time.
nonapplause People always say  "Well  what's your plan?"
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a White House Reception Honoring Vladimir Feltsman
nonapplause Obviously how we treat our veterans is hugely important  but I just want to make a quick comment about the decision made public today by Ken Feinberg on executive compensation.
nonapplause It violates the very values that led the United States and the United Kingdom to fight side by side in the 1940s and remained allied since.
nonapplause Now  that can't be fixed with a tax credit.
nonapplause So when we talk about young democracies  like those emerging in the Broader Middle East today  we must do so with great humility and with great patience and with great sympathy for their historic undertaking.
nonapplause Now  President Reagan used to say the test for whether somebody got reelected was  or whether a party was continued in office was whether you were better off than you were eight years ago.
nonapplause This was his reply: "The sensitive place in the body  physical or social  is where something is wrong."
nonapplause Once there  they used the block vote  the closed shop and the union rule book to dragoon their members into politically-motivated strikes and perpetual unrest.
nonapplause We're a country on the move.
nonapplause We can extend economic opportunity to the people and places that have been left behind.
nonapplause There's plenty of things we could do there.
nonapplause You're serving in an eventful time for the country  and for the cause of freedom.
nonapplause Well  I was in one of those families that was always part of the 36.
nonapplause She said  "I feel like an adult again.
nonapplause All of us know that crucial debates lie ahead  just as we know that this New Year will bring its own challenges for our country.
nonapplause In the meantime  the Conservative Party has the vital task of shaking the British public out of a long sleep.
nonapplause The truth is we're in the 63d month of this nonstop expansion.
nonapplause We just passed this welfare reform bill which I signed and voted for because I believed it.
nonapplause Now  it's also known  however  that the changes that are underway today will place great stresses on the Social Security safety net.
nonapplause And I was laying there contemplating my future  wondering whether or not I was going to be able to continue my political career and so forth.
nonapplause No  seriously  it wasn't funny at all  and I thank you for the prayers you said that day -- especially your prayers for three very brave men -- Special Agent Tim McCarthy  Tom Delahanty  and press spokesman Jim Brady.
nonapplause But one point I want to make is that it is and will be our policy to oppose protectionism at home and abroad and to foster the continued pattern of ever freer trade which has served the world so well.
nonapplause Education is an important part of making sure that the entrepreneurial spirit reaches everybody in America.
nonapplause To taking on the gun issue and tobacco issue  to lobbying for NASA at the beginning and now all the calls he's made on China PNTR at the end  he's been there.
nonapplause And the new jobs that are finally being created pay $9 000 less on average than the jobs that are being exported overseas.
nonapplause There's a lot more  but part of it's about marriage and some of the experts say that a typical marriage has three stages: romantic infatuation  power struggles where each tries to remake the other and then mutual acceptance.
nonapplause I wish I could stay in Fort Worth and hear your concert.
nonapplause I think this is the most dangerous time for all of us.
nonapplause And I'm very grateful for their friendship  and I want to thank Dwight  Toni and Ann and Vernon one more time for being there for our family tonight.
nonapplause We got them through because we're with the American people.
nonapplause We are well-positioned.
nonapplause It is something you have to make  in every generation  and it will be your achievement -- not only for yourselves individually  but for your generation  for your community and for the larger community that is America.
nonapplause We need to provide farms a legal way to hire the workers they rely on  and a path for those workers to earn legal status.
nonapplause Probably we were both right.
nonapplause It's been an incredibly informative visit.
nonapplause Our founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity  the rights of every person  and the possibilities of every life.
nonapplause Hold fast to your dreams  he said  America needs them.
nonapplause The Government of National Unity has made significant strides in laying the foundations for the two interrelated tasks that we face -- national reconciliation and reconstruction; nation building and development.
nonapplause I think there's also a lot of truth to the old wisdom that you should choose your friends carefully.
nonapplause But when you're young  you're not very experienced and so sometimes you're going to hit that pothole  all right  and you're going to have a down period.
nonapplause We've got to make those investments.
nonapplause We have to jumpstart the credit markets and get private lending going again.
nonapplause In a speech in Bruges 18 months ago  which generated some slight interest  I urged the European Community not to be too introspective and not to forget that Prague  Warsaw and Budapest are great European cities which have traditionally been at the centre of our Continent's history.
nonapplause But I see Michigan's optimistic spirit right here in Saginaw.
nonapplause The job of democratic leaders is to warn that measures which may seem easy or even popular  which may end some immediate conflict  must be resisted if in the end they risk destroying democracy itself.
nonapplause He said we need more jobs  but he didn't know the answer.
nonapplause A thriving  competitive America is within our reach -- but only if we move forward as one nation; only if we move past the old debates and the crippling divides between left and right  between business and labor  between private enterprise and the public sector.
nonapplause We know that even though nearly four years have passed since 9/11  we have continuing  urgent duties and responsibilities.
nonapplause But let's be clear -– I think all the teachers here would agree with me this is not the responsibility of teachers alone.
nonapplause The things  in other words  that people who were alienated from government and who voted for Ross Perot wanted  we are doing.
nonapplause We also had nearly a trillion-dollar debt.
nonapplause That was in fact achieved by Oslo.
nonapplause We're going to need one another  not just here in Washington but across the country.
nonapplause I also want to express to the people of Columbus our sadness at the fire that was here that was so destructive to lives here in Columbus.
nonapplause Our presidency now lies under a cloud of humiliation and shame that is the direct result of the loss of our moral compass and our moral principles.
nonapplause And we've taken a whole series of steps that make the U.S. a tougher target.
nonapplause He was wrong and the President was right.
nonapplause But they also respect us for other things.
nonapplause I read: "In memory of the faithful service in World War II lest we forget."
nonapplause It is your nest egg.
nonapplause Meanwhile  I assure you that we will be unrelenting in our efforts to continue Reinventing Government -- to give you a government that costs less  does more  empowers employees  and listens to the people who pay for it.
nonapplause And we're going to cut rules for special interests  gut regulations that protect clean air and clean water and things that most of us value.
nonapplause But he boasts  “I have consistently supported legislation  time after time  which increases taxes on my own constituents.” Doesn't that make you want to be one of his constituents?
nonapplause In his two terms in Congress now  Sam has earned a reputation as a hard worker and a leader with strong principles.
nonapplause But it has been a family affair.
nonapplause Well  Judy  don't let anybody forget about you.
nonapplause So  here we are living in modern times.
nonapplause In the rubble of Afghanistan  we've found confirmation  if any were needed  that bin Laden and the al Qaeda network were seriously interested in nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons.
nonapplause And I want you to know that the United States of America will be a partner for you in that future.
nonapplause But I reject the idea that it should never be changed.
nonapplause My Middle Class Task Force and the Council on Environmental Quality recently released a report titled "Recovery Through Retrofit " that explains some of these hurdles and how we can overcome them: providing homeowners with straightforward and reliable information on retrofitting their homes  reducing their costs to do it  and ensuring that we've got a well-trained workforce ready to make it happen.
nonapplause They all cleared the report  and we sent it up to the president and it got bounced by the national security advisor or deputy.
nonapplause Against such enemies  America and the civilized world have only one option: wherever terrorists operate  we must find them where they dwell  stop them in their planning  and one by one bring them to justice.
nonapplause Now  you've gotten ahead of me a little bit here  because I thought I'd conduct an informal poll and you would speak up loudly and let all America hear.
nonapplause Now  there is a lot of controversy in Congress about this vote.
nonapplause In doing so  you are leaders in promoting fundamental American values of hard work  family  freedom  and faith.
nonapplause I'll just mention a few.
nonapplause My daughter knows more about it than I do  but I'm learning myself just in the things that we do incredibly how much more we can do -- and at a tiny fraction of the space involved  not to mention the speed.
nonapplause Maybe most important of all  in spite of everything  gridlock is being dealt with.
nonapplause Again  I want to thank our Council members for their excitement and enthusiasm.
nonapplause But to get that done  we have to first of all  expect the fact that ideas matter and that how you turn ideas into policies matter  and then you've got to keep score.
nonapplause But we're moving.
nonapplause We'll continue  obviously  to spend a lot of time and energy going forward because the war on terror is with us for the foreseeable future.
nonapplause I've got such fond memories of working with people here in the great state of Texas.
nonapplause With advance appropriations  veterans' medical care will be funded a year in advance.
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen  to state the obvious  this is truly a historic day.
nonapplause Some take advantage of the economic anxiety that people are feeling to stoke fear of those who look or think or worship differently -- to inflame passions between “us” and “them.”
nonapplause And over the next few days  you're going to be talking about spiraling costs that are straining your budgets and running up all of our deficits -- costs like the nearly $150 billion a year that we spend on obesity-related conditions like diabetes  heart disease  and high blood pressure.
nonapplause We passed a series of reforms that won't just change policy in Washington  but changes how Washington work.
nonapplause And he nourished the dream for many years that he would  in fact  walk again.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech to US Olympic Training Center Community
nonapplause You all didn't sign on this for being your day job  but it's become your day job  at least for the year or so you're away from your family.
nonapplause It will not be long before the inflation figure starts to fall.
nonapplause Most of them have worked hard.
nonapplause In January of 1977  just after Jerry Ford left the White House  inflation was at 4.8 percent.
nonapplause Now  as I say  it's only round one  but  oh boy  what a round!
nonapplause I hope we can rapidly develop a closer association between Czechoslovakia and the European Community which will restore those links and you will have our enthusiastic support too for your intention to join the Council of Europe.
nonapplause We want to create an independent group of doctors and medical experts who will be able to eliminate waste and inefficiency  which could save us money and strengthen programs for our seniors.
nonapplause And we've had a recovery that's produced 6.3 million new jobs  the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 25 years  and we need to spread the benefits of the recovery.
nonapplause Their time had much in common with ours and  therefore  our responsibilities have much in common with theirs -- to preserve what is enduring  but to adapt our nation time and again to what is new.
nonapplause What he has not shared  however  is a single example of the Patriot Act actually being abused.
nonapplause We don't want to look at the truth.
nonapplause And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security.
nonapplause For it was with the writing of our Constitution  setting down the architecture of democratic government  that the noble sentiments and brave rhetoric of 1776 took on substance  that the hopes and dreams of the revolutionists could become a living  enduring reality.
nonapplause And we also know  as the President said last night from the podium when we were sitting right here that a lot of you have a FY'11 budget that's pretty steep as well  but last year out a lot of you were able to keep firefighters  school teachers  police officers on the job.
nonapplause A young person entering the military at the start of the last century could scarcely have imagined what was to come  the advent of air power  world wars and weapons of mass destruction  satellites and space flight  the rise of militant ideologies  and the great democratic alliances formed to defeat them.
nonapplause Let me repeat that: It is a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade -- and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid.
nonapplause There is a lot of personal experience out there.
nonapplause If this museum can mobilize morality  then those who have perished will thereby gain a measure of immortality.
nonapplause This is only the beginning.
nonapplause That is what I am trying to do in Washington.
nonapplause The President is hopeful about our future  because he has tremendous confidence in the American people.
nonapplause What kind of people have we become  when  on the one hand  we say that it takes courage to do the obvious  and  on the other hand  we don't see the obvious?
nonapplause And I am reminded  as I think of our brave soldiers from all over the country and all their backgrounds doing their work today in Haiti  that in World War II African Americans were kept segregated in units in the army until the Battle of the Bulge at the end of the war had so many casualties that blacks and whites had to fight together.
nonapplause I remember it vividly.
nonapplause Thank you very much  and thank you for that warm welcome to San Jose.
nonapplause Jack  on the case.
nonapplause We have to deal with the fact that while we talk about having smaller  more entrepreneurial government  the truth is that in a lot of poor countries  they don't have any government at all with any real  fundamental capacity to do the things that have to be done.
nonapplause And we all congratulate Peter Hubbard-Miles on his splendid victory in last year's General Election.
nonapplause I care deeply about the unemployed.
nonapplause As I say  this is a somewhat experimental format.
nonapplause This democracy will bring peace for all  reconciliation among all  respect and justice for every single citizen.
nonapplause He's asked me to extend his gratitude to each and every one of you.
nonapplause Now  why should the progressive party  the Democratic Party  be for getting the country out of debt?
nonapplause There are a number of subsidies to business and industry that I believe are unnecessary  not because the activities being subsidized aren't of value  but because the marketplace contains incentives enough to warrant continuing these activities without a government subsidy.
nonapplause They're helping to bring down unemployment  and they've set this economy on the path to long-term economic growth.
nonapplause You know  I believe that we were doing the right thing to strive for a community that gave opportunity to every responsible citizen and it respected all different people's belief and tried to work on things we could agree on  like stability for middle class families  opportunity for all young people  security for seniors.
nonapplause That's why we've set up the Broadcasting Standards Council.
nonapplause He spoke a fundamental truth when he said  work is an important way in which we exercise our humanity.
nonapplause For example  we will ask others to take responsibility for some of those now in Guantanamo  as we determine to close it.
nonapplause We'll make our case to the American people as plainly as we can possibly make it.
nonapplause And in return  they practice charity.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a Republican Campaign Rally in Bowling Green  Ohio
nonapplause But let's be clear  this isn't just about changing what our kids are eating and the lifestyles they're leading -- it's also about changing our own habits as well.
nonapplause She paid more than $4 000 in out-of-pocket medical costs  for co-pays and medical care and prescriptions.
nonapplause It's an unbelievable privilege to be President.
nonapplause Now  why is it?
nonapplause Senator Hart said  "Walter Mondale may pledge stable prices  but Carter-Mondale couldn't cut 12-percent inflation."
nonapplause We're witnessing a rebirth of concern and involvement that historians may describe as a reawakening of the American spirit.
nonapplause So that's what we're trying to do.
nonapplause I'm very grateful the American people have done all the things they have done.
nonapplause And we took it on because it's the single best way -- in fact  the only way -- that we are actually going to get control of our federal budget.
nonapplause If I'm not doing any job at 120 percent  I think I'm failing.
nonapplause And we have to cure them both.
nonapplause They don't hold us to separate standards.
nonapplause These  your farewell words to Prime Minister Rabin echoed throughout our land.
nonapplause He signed your first charter in the midst of the Civil War where he had the vision to see not just farmland and a tiny school  but the fact that we could use education to tear down the walls between us  to touch and improve lives and lift the spirits of those who for too long had been kept down.
nonapplause This election is not over.
nonapplause I enjoy a good contest if it is a contest of ideas.
nonapplause My responsibility to you and to the millions of American workers is to prepare them  and us  for that tomorrow.
nonapplause I'm delighted to be here with Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich.
nonapplause George Bush is heading up a task force that has already cut the increase in government regulations in half.
nonapplause And I don't have to tell you in the business community; if more and more resources are channeled into the government bureaucracy  consumers will have less and less to spend and business will have less to invest and create new jobs.
nonapplause You know economists; they're the sort of people who see something works in practice and wonder if it would work in theory.
nonapplause And not because we want votes but because we want to hold the country together  and we need to see that across our differences we have some shared values.
nonapplause We passed trade promotion authority to open up new markets for California manufacturers and farmers and ranchers and entrepreneurs.
nonapplause Some of you have worked in organizations which have helped poor families move from welfare to work  in a way that reenforces not only the value of work  but the value of family  which is even more important.
nonapplause And the ladies of the village were in their Indian costumes  and they were very beautiful  and they danced.
nonapplause There is no greater incentive to listening than the fact that you don't know anything.
nonapplause That's why it's going to take a broader team effort with everyone pitching in  and it's going to take government doing its part.
nonapplause But on this night  something was different.
nonapplause Mr. Speaker  wars are not caused by strength or by armaments.
nonapplause Who appoints the ministers here?
nonapplause I want to say a special word of appreciation to Peter Benchley  for the work that he has done for nearly a lifetime now and for the remarks he made.
nonapplause Say yes.
nonapplause Well  I thank Frank for that very kind introduction  those generous words  and I thank each and every one of you for coming out for this send-off.
nonapplause And 48 of those 58 years  they've had both Houses of the Congress.
nonapplause The high-tech Information Age means that all large bureaucracies will be restructured  that more decisions will be pushed down to the grass roots  that people will be able to make more decisions for themselves.
nonapplause They have proved themselves incapable of acting in the interest of the nation as a whole.
nonapplause And let me say that progress should spur us on  for there is still too much poverty  still too much lack of economic and educational opportunity.
nonapplause It's said that if you put 10 economists in a room and ask a question  you'll get 10 different answers.
nonapplause In the year 2027  it will be $200 billion in the red -- $200 billion for one year alone.
nonapplause Nothing in the world matters if something's wrong with your family.
nonapplause It's too bad I couldn't make it.
nonapplause and here's our plan to cut it in half  and after we do that  we'll go on and get rid of it.
nonapplause Welcome to the White House.
nonapplause This year 1 in 4 of all people who die on earth will die of AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and infections related to diarrhea  little children who never get any clean water.
nonapplause And we intend to make good use of every day we have the honor of serving the American people.

nonapplause Don't let anybody deter you and say you shouldn't be doing it.
nonapplause Together  we can give every single child in this country a chance to grow up in a world where the only limits are the outlines of their hopes and dreams.

nonapplause And it is important that we set a good example.

nonapplause I fully understand that oftentimes when they stress the Social Security issue  people try to scare you about it  saying  if old George W. has his way  you're not going to get a dime.

nonapplause The Democratic Party's fundamental mission is to expand opportunity  not government.
nonapplause My Lord Mayor  there is a town in Belgium called Bruges.

nonapplause These are important national priorities  and we ought to be dealing with them this year.
nonapplause And as long as this administration is responsible for the Nation's foreign policy  we will protect the freedom of our own citizens and we will pursue liberty for all people.
nonapplause "Well " he says  "I like the drumstick  Ma likes the drumstick  Junior came along and he likes the drumstick  and we got tired of fighting over them  so I raised them with three legs."

nonapplause Think  think  think  and speak.

nonapplause The Prime Minister said as much the other day when he did his best to make Conservative noises.
nonapplause Their wonderful idea is -- can you bear the suspense?

nonapplause There are millions of Americans today who cannot change jobs because somebody in their family has been sick.
nonapplause We've helped reach an agreement to raise fuel economy standards.
nonapplause It was my argument.

nonapplause First  those who apply for mortgages should be made aware of all the costs and warned about predatory lenders who take advantage of inexperienced buyers.

nonapplause But we're also honoring the institution our parents entered into and carried on: the institution of marriage and the family itself.
nonapplause Together  let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few  but all of our families.
nonapplause Doesn't that divert too much of our attention away from the principal danger?
nonapplause Under President Bush's leadership  the United States is now standing shoulder to shoulder with moderate men and women all across the Middle East.
nonapplause They work to live not the other way around  so it's a great place to come.
nonapplause And after I got here  I discovered some of the best ideas in Washington were not being implemented simply because there was no anger attached to them.
nonapplause We have worked like crazy to hammer these ideas into policies.
nonapplause The road to recovery will not be straight.
nonapplause But what is the goal here?
nonapplause It's creating jobs -- almost 15 million new jobs.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at University of Michigan Spring Commencement
nonapplause See  cargo ships will be able to load 300 more containers than they can now.
nonapplause We must beware of Smokescreen Socialism  of the cloud of excuses  explanations and justifications  which billow from Labour spokesmen whether they are sitting on the Government Front Bench—or sitting on their hands in the voting lobbies trying to stop Parliament reaching awkward votes.
nonapplause No family should ever have to endure the nightmare of losing a child.
nonapplause In their minds  his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government.
nonapplause Among other things  in that tiny country  so much smaller than the United States  there are 1 million homeless people.
nonapplause God bless you all.
nonapplause It's a wonderful and moving experience to be in the presence of this historic document.
nonapplause That is why I have asked Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan to convene the finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 and key emerging economies in Washington within 30 days to develop a preliminary report to the heads of state by the beginning of next year on strengthening the world financial system.
nonapplause And I believe we have a unique opportunity here to bring free enterprise to people who have been left behind.
nonapplause If we're not  what is different?

nonapplause And the schools can't get enough teachers to put enough people in the classroom with the kind of academic background.
nonapplause He has said: "I've always believed that people listen to your music not to find out about you  but to find out about themselves."
nonapplause As long as it takes  we will stay on the offensive  and stay in the fight until the fight is won.
nonapplause And let me try to put this into what I think is a realistic context.
nonapplause Well  in some ways I think we're like the pioneers who won the West -- we can stick together  stand together  and move on together  or we can retreat in small groups from the challenges of a great new world.
nonapplause We've got a lot of other good folks here.
nonapplause I wholeheartedly support this approach and believe that Americans will continue their generosity.
nonapplause I find that so  so sad.
nonapplause After all their sacrifices  after all they've done for us  will we keep faith with these families?
nonapplause Somalia  where we are trying to conclude our mission and leave those people a fighting chance not to go back to times when hundreds of thousands of children died like flies in the streets.
nonapplause We need responsibility.
nonapplause We know the budget constraints facing local governments in these tough times.
nonapplause But they say Washington will do it.
nonapplause They deride our war on drugs -- stranger still.
nonapplause General George Marshall once described our secret weapon in World War II as -- when he was asked what it was  he said  "Just the best blankety-blank kids in the world."
nonapplause The notion that government controls  central planning  and bureaucracy can provide cost-free prosperity has now come and gone the way of the hula-hoop  the Nehru jackets  and the all-asparagus diet.
nonapplause Values mean having an opportunity  agenda  for metropolitan America.
nonapplause That's why  if we don't do anything  you're going to end up paying more taxes  or we have to cut benefits.
nonapplause So across the board  what you see is a governing philosophy on their part that basically comes down to we're going to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest among us -- folks who don't need those tax cuts and weren't even asking for them  which would cost $700 billion -- these are the folks who say they're concerned about the deficit but are willing to spent $700 to those who are luckiest and least in need in our society.
nonapplause And we've got challenges in terms of bringing about peace in the Middle East.
nonapplause That policy rests upon close  cooperative  respectful relations among our countries.
nonapplause Thank you and God bless.
nonapplause That's why today  I'm proud to officially launch our second annual United We Serve Summer Service Initiative.
nonapplause On the last night of his life  he did seem to sense that grave danger was lying in wait.
nonapplause We must also keep in mind economics.
nonapplause After all  small business tax relief is not a substitute for ingenuity and industriousness by our entrepreneurs -- but it can help those with good ideas to grow and expand.
nonapplause I know how difficult it is for members of Congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now.
nonapplause Now  that's a tough enough task for most adults.
nonapplause And yet that's not how they saw themselves.
nonapplause I'm proud to announce tonight that the Clinton-Gore campaign has appointed to serve as honorary campaign chairs Alma Brown and Congressman John Lewis.

nonapplause And my Mayor  Mayor Williams  thank you.
nonapplause Our policy consistently has been to bring peace and freedom to all of Central America.
nonapplause Well  speaking of getting out of the room  I'm going to see each of you in the Blue Room down the line here for a handshake  which I wasn't able to do at the beginning of our lunch here.
nonapplause They're kidding.
nonapplause The latest  of course  is about Japanese imports of American beef products.
nonapplause Look at all of you!
nonapplause In other countries  whether China or Germany or Brazil  they've been able to align the interests of business  workers  and government around trade agreements that open up new markets for them and create new jobs for them.
nonapplause I think it would be folly for us to walk away from arms control after the United States has led the way not just in my administration  but in previous administrations  Republicans and Democrats.
nonapplause And so what brings us here tonight is indeed an effort to sustain the work that is required  so that that decision to being taken with respect to the life of that little baby here in the womb will be a decision that conforms with the will of God  and  therefore  with the principles of Godly justice that are the basis for our claim to rights and liberty.
nonapplause And we've got a problem with Social Security and Medicare and I'll tell you why.
nonapplause Let me just say first to Craig and Jane I'm very  very grateful to be in their home here -- I've also been in their home in New York City.
nonapplause I used to tell the folks in my great state of Texas  I said  I welcome the Hispanic influence in our state.
nonapplause America must move ahead  and that's why we're the greatest country in the world  because we've always been a people that have moved ahead  never satisfied with things as they are.
nonapplause Is it top of the agenda?
nonapplause We must exercise responsibility not just at home  but around the world.
nonapplause We should be better stewards of fiscal responsibility and the taxpayers' money but also our natural environment.
nonapplause Instead of having the welfare being an individual entitlement to every poor person on welfare  should we just give you whatever money we gave you last year or over the last three years and let you spend it however you want?
nonapplause The principal said  Mr. President  we're so glad to have you here with all the parents here; I only wish that we could have translated your talk into Spanish and Arabic.
nonapplause But yesterday  David Kay  who is the man that's been designated to go supervise something called the Iraqi survey group -- this is a group of technical experts  gone to Iraq.
nonapplause Even home care is expensive  as you have just heard -- in terms of direct costs  low income  and enormous challenges to family time and parent time.
nonapplause We believe that the brain that you have  the ability to think  your experience in this hell that we've all been through  is all the credentials you need when you come to a membership meeting with your suggestions.
nonapplause My name is Steve McAllister  and I am the interim director of the Dole Institute.
nonapplause Let's stop overspending with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
nonapplause I particularly want to say thanks to Elaine Steele  Representative of the Rosa Parks Institute.
nonapplause Why do I say that my colleague and I can lead America in these critical years ahead?
nonapplause And I just think there are no better signs of economic realism permeating through  and willingness of people  too.
nonapplause And one that might be used on the battlefield.
nonapplause We have gained so much from our commitment to free institutions  the dignity of the individual  the spirit of enterprise  and we feel an obligation to help others trying to make their way along the same path.
nonapplause I'm telling you  if people believe this election is about building the future of our dreams for our children  he will win  Hillary will win  Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will win  and we will have a great celebration on election night.
nonapplause These people had been living together on the same land for 500 years.
nonapplause We simply have to develop the talents of all of our people.
nonapplause Gregory Steven Brock.
nonapplause What are you going to do -- if you decide that that's what you want.
nonapplause Is it exciting?
nonapplause The old regime gave the Hiba School no help.
nonapplause And others will point to other things which point up the greatness of America: our great natural resources  for example.
nonapplause Everything responds to trust and confidence.
nonapplause Those 90 000 corporations that made a profit last year but paid no Federal taxes are recovering.
nonapplause And in less than a year  through that position  I worked with others to build the university's first Office of Community Service.
nonapplause But why did you have to come into being?
nonapplause Well  we've got 19.4 million jobs  and for six years in a row we've set records every year for new small businesses getting started.
nonapplause I went to a village co-op in Nayla  Rajastan  India  last year  last March  and I was astonished to see the women's milk co-op doing all of its billing on computers and marketing on computers.
nonapplause It's not.
nonapplause But today  whether we like it or not  America is still needed.
nonapplause Now the question is  What about those who criticize this record  what about those who raise questions about it?
nonapplause These programs can work.
nonapplause A bunch of you guys remember that.
nonapplause I didn't realize he was so articulate.
nonapplause Since 1965 the violent crime rate has increased sevenfold.

nonapplause A country which has no confidence in its currency  can have no confidence in itself.
nonapplause And they will see your whole country in a different light.
nonapplause Call Washington!” Well  now what in the world could be the matter?
nonapplause Yet bit by bit  through diplomacy and by force  with our allies and partners  we are acting to shrink the area in which they can operate freely.
nonapplause It's fair to tax corporate profits; that's fair.
nonapplause Then the housing bubble burst.
nonapplause Also  the American people spend less than one percent of their budget on foreign assistance  the lowest of any country in the world with an advanced economy.
nonapplause That ought to seem like a lot for people whose pay raise hasn't gone up by 4 percent over the last couple of years.
nonapplause Thomas Jefferson wrote the words  but Franklin Roosevelt lived them out every day.
nonapplause As I mentioned last night  our economy was in a full-blown crisis; 750 000 Americans were losing their jobs each month  and millions more were hurting at the end of one of the toughest decades for the middle class on record.
nonapplause They want opportunity and workable answers.
nonapplause As I said in my convention speech in New York  I'm mindful now that I have an opponent.
nonapplause And after last winter's freeze  we directed the Farmers Home Administration to make more loans to local families without adequate housing.
nonapplause Our mission in Iraq is a great undertaking and part of a larger mission that the United States accepted now more than two years ago.
nonapplause I look forward to working with you to continue to lay the foundations of peace  so that generations after our time will look at all of us and say  job well done.
nonapplause I don't run for the office of the Presidency saying that if I am elected life will be easy  but I do assure you that if we are elected we will cause this country to move again.
nonapplause Indeed  one of the men who went to college on the GI Bill  as I mentioned  was my grandfather  and I would not be standing here today if that opportunity had not led him West in search of opportunity.
nonapplause I said  "How do you think I got the job?"
nonapplause Mark Lennox is the same age as our daughter  15.
nonapplause We're working to make our public schools the best in the world  with smaller classes  better facilities  more master teachers and charter schools  higher standards  and end to social promotion.
nonapplause I want also to thank Judge Riley for administering the oath.
nonapplause This contest is between those who say  "You never had it so good" and those who say  "We can do better."
nonapplause One is our domestic strength  the maintenance of full employment  a strong and vital society  a strong educational system  the development of our resources and a moving America.
nonapplause I want to thank Rod for that wonderful introduction and for everything that he's done and the Central Virginia Health Services are doing to keep families and communities healthy across this nation.
nonapplause So when somebody tells you  when you hear the excuse  oh  we're not meeting our needs  you need to get them to look at the numbers; you need to get them to understand what a 4 percent growth means.
nonapplause That's what's also in this jobs plan.
nonapplause The idea here is very simple: that in order for care to be effective  it needs to be coordinated.
nonapplause Ninety years ago  Dr. Carter G. Woodson recognized the need for our country to gain a more complete and informed understanding of our past  so he formed the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History and he established the first Negro History Week.
nonapplause We must support our nation�s police and emergency personnel  because the demands of your job are greater than ever.
nonapplause If it hadn't been for Al Gore I couldn't have done it.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President In Independence Day Celebration
nonapplause Let me  before I go  ask you something.
nonapplause This still leaves many people in need of help.
nonapplause SDI will give us the possibility to base deterrence increasingly on defenses which threaten no one rather than on the threat of nuclear retaliation.
nonapplause So our financial rescue plan takes some of the following steps to address this.
nonapplause The economy took a body blow from this financial crisis and this great recession that we're going through.
nonapplause It's private medicine  financed by the American people.
nonapplause I know we have to reduce the deficit.
nonapplause Now  isn't it about time they started protecting the family budget instead of fattening the Federal budget?
nonapplause I can't tell you how good it feels to be out of Washington and back in the heartland of America.
nonapplause Now  this can immediately dissolve into a huge political screaming match in which one party sticks up for one  the other sticks up for the other  everybody gets reelected at election time and nobody gets anything done.
nonapplause Now  law enforcement is a part of the answer.
nonapplause But  in fact  it was the beginning of a period of transition.
nonapplause We also favor dramatic reforms in the education and secondary education act.
nonapplause I'm not going to give up on that either.
nonapplause And I trust they will do so soon.
nonapplause But I know the principles involved in the bill  and I want to share some of those with you.
nonapplause It is not domestic surveillance.
nonapplause That is  what do you think it will be?
nonapplause And that's precisely what we must do.
nonapplause But getting through four years of wartime without another 9/11 took a lot more than just luck.
nonapplause If we're resolute in our search for an agreement while  at the same time  firm in protecting our own interests  arms reduction can be a reality.
nonapplause If Congress stays on the path of spending restraint the President has proposed  we can meet the nation's priorities and still cut the deficit in half over the next five years.
nonapplause They carried out one attack after another -- on U.S. Marines in Beirut in 1983; on the World Trade Center in New York in 1993; and the same year on American special forces in Somalia.
nonapplause Americans are working again  and America is working again.
nonapplause Because the stakes are so high  we must do everything we can to encourage a Russia that is fully democratic and united in its diversity; a Russia that defines its greatness not by dominance of its neighbors  but by the dominant achievements of its people and its partnership; a Russia that should be  indeed  must be  fully part of Europe.
nonapplause And as I said in the State of the Union  my goal is not to punish Wall Street.
nonapplause We've moved to stem the serious loss of vital wetlands  and we've set aside millions of acres of wilderness  created 29 new wildlife refuges  and protected thousands of miles of scenic rivers and trails.
nonapplause For us  loyalty to the United States is paramount because we share so many basic beliefs.
nonapplause They are traits that allowed us to look at our inextricable ties to our environment and invent new ways to protect our natural wonders from harm in the last three decades.
nonapplause They send our answer to that military mom who wrote me asking that we never forget or ignore our military families.
nonapplause You know  you'd never think about sending a police force out unless they've trained in how to use their guns; unless they knew how to put on their bulletproof vests; unless they knew how to give someone their Miranda warnings; unless they knew these things.
nonapplause -- Developments  one of Cumbria's high-tech firms beat off the competition to supply the state of the art communications system used by sports commentators at the Seoul Olympics—another very great success.
nonapplause It's difficult to get word.
nonapplause That's great.
nonapplause But we also know and the President is absolutely convinced and absolutely right that there's no such thing as a perfect defense.
nonapplause That's all your doing.
nonapplause If you want to keep doing well  you've got to try to do better.
nonapplause And I hope and pray that the Congress will agree to adopt that when they come back in just a few days  or early next year at the very latest.
nonapplause Their big idea for the economy: raise your taxes.
nonapplause Happily  the digital divide has begun to narrow  but it will not disappear of its own accord.
nonapplause When you go to a patient's bedside  you ask why does it hurt  where does it hurt  how can I help?
nonapplause I'm honored to be here with Denny Lawson.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech to the Federalist Society's National Lawyers' Convention
nonapplause I've done many commencement speeches  but I can say with absolute certainty  without fear of contradiction  since I've been in public life there has never been a graduating class that is graduating into a moment where they actually have a chance to make more than incremental change.
nonapplause The airline security legislation just passed by the Congress is a very good step.
nonapplause But we have a strategy to try to bring free enterprise -- not government jobs  free enterprise -- to those places.
nonapplause So  Steve  if you'd step forward  I'll be happy to administer the oath.
nonapplause Now that doesn't mean  and don't get me wrong  that doesn't mean we don't care about these other issues  because when you think it through  if you want to rebuild families then you better start by rebuilding the material resource base of the family  and that means you've got to reclaim control of the money and the income from the government.
nonapplause With that assistance  I cannot fail.
nonapplause This country is the only hope of freedom.
nonapplause It has been expressed by commission after commission appointed in the last 8 years  by distinguished Republican after distinguished Republican  by general after general  who has warned that the relative power of the United States and of the free world is not rising as fast as it must  if we are to maintain ourselves and the cause of freedom around the globe.
nonapplause The United States of America is a good country  a decent country  and we are making the world a better place by defending the innocent  confronting the violent  and bringing freedom to the oppressed.
nonapplause No Italian will ever jump up in my face and start putting bad mouth on me  because I know his history.
nonapplause People like Jim McLamore and Tibor Hollo have given new meaning to the term "committed."
nonapplause Colorado doesn't need a Senator whose record 1 year was rated 95 percent by the ultraliberal ADA  who continually votes to slash defense  but who -- from a high-tech State like this one -- consistently votes to slash funds for Strategic Defense Initiative  a high-tech defense that offers the hope of a future free from the fear of nuclear attack.
nonapplause That was a very important thing for us to do because they are growing very fast  and we did not want this world to break up into geographical trading blocks in ways that would shrink the potential of the people of Canada and the United States for decades to come.
nonapplause Right now  for example  at this moment of economic challenge  one of the greatest concerns is that we'll see state and local governments forced to lay off police officers -- even though we know that crime has a tendency to go up when the economy is in dire straits.
nonapplause Now  whether it's their opposition to voluntary prayer in school  support for gun control  or the leftwing judges appointed in a State like Massachusetts  or a weak-kneed defense policy  their views can only be described by the dreaded "L" word: liberal  liberal  liberal.
nonapplause We had one right after World War II when the Cold War started and we had to adapt to having to confront the Soviet Union.
nonapplause And containment is not possible when dictators obtain weapons of mass destruction and are prepared to share them with terrorists who intend to inflict catastrophic losses on the United States.
nonapplause And we're going to try to agree on a resolution of these big  thorny issues that the parties agreed on the White House lawn in September of 1993 they would come to terms with a good while before now.
nonapplause Yes  they do.
nonapplause Of course  there have been several other collisions between President Bush's ideology and America's reality.
nonapplause I think you're going to like it.
nonapplause For others  the outlook is more bleak.
nonapplause In this new  more dynamic economy where we're creating more jobs than we have in a very long time  but where people are also feeling the sting of change  it is more important than ever before to pass this legislation.
nonapplause Maybe it's time they felt some pressure from the grassroots.
nonapplause Governor  thank you very much.
nonapplause It is as stark as that gash of a border that separates the German people.
nonapplause And my argument was always that government is neither  that the role of government is to create the conditions and get people the tools to make the most of their own lives.
nonapplause Another project will establish a technology center in Cerritos  California to transfer leading-edge composites manufacturing technology to 16 000 small defense and commercial firms just in the Los Angeles area.
nonapplause You owe it to yourselves to go out and make sure he wins on Tuesday.
nonapplause Fourthly  what the Russians are doing in Angola is against detente.
nonapplause Well now  this housing bill also makes some progress in eliminating ineffective programs  such as the Solar Energy Bank  the Rental Housing Development Grant  and the section 235 subsidy programs.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a Republican Campaign Rally in Raleigh  North Carolina
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen  we are living in a moment of great hope and possibility.
nonapplause So the first thing I want you to say to somebody who says  well I'm too conservative to vote for Barbara Boxer  or  I'm a Republican  or I'm this -- say  look  you're a Californian  you're an American; look where you are now  look where you were then  their ideas were right.
nonapplause And I hope everyone of you will support that because I think it is terribly important.
nonapplause Just since you were in middle school  you've witnessed terrorism touch our soil  you've seen the cost of war reach into our communities.
nonapplause And if it were a show on Broadway  it would be “Promises  Promises.”   And if his administration were a novel  a book  you'd have to read it from the back to the front in order to get a happy ending.
nonapplause I'm here to celebrate the graduation of the public high schools in the Hamilton County and Chattanooga city school systems.
nonapplause We need Kit Bond in the United States Senate to stand up to the liberal big-spenders and their tax hike schemes and keep America on the track of growth  prosperity  and freedom.
nonapplause I have done everything I can as President to heal the kind of divisive  destructive  political climate that has come to dominate too much of the discourse in Washington -- the automatic assumption that anybody who is different from you has got something terrible wrong with them -- the feeling that anything you can do to beat somebody who is your opponent  no matter how much you have to denigrate them  is all right.
nonapplause And the entire world must know that we will take whatever action is necessary to defend our freedom and our security.
nonapplause Businesses object to some of the provisions in the Employee Free Choice Act  because one of the things that's in there is something called card check  where rather than have a secret ballot and organize a big election  you could simply have enough employees  a majority of employees  check a card and that would then form the union.
nonapplause That was the last act the Senate took prior to coming home for the August break.
nonapplause But I think I know how the rumor got started.
nonapplause There had been a series of terrorist attacks prior to that overseas and here in the U.S. We'd seen the first attack on the World Trade Center  in 1993; the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia  in '96; the bombing our of our embassies in East Africa  in '98; and the USS Cole  in 2000 -- and each of those had been treated as sort of an individual criminal enterprise.
nonapplause We've got to put our country first and restore independence to the White House  not compromise our economic and environment  and health security and safety by yielding to the special interests and the extreme ideologues.
nonapplause And one of the reasons you can't turn your back on Iraq and allow whatever happens there to happen  but have to work to make certain we get a democratically elected government in place is so that Iraq doesn't become that kind of breeding ground for terror  or revert back to Saddam-like government.
nonapplause We're looking forward to next year's campaign.
nonapplause We can have tax cuts  my fellow Americans  but they have to be paid for and they ought to be targeted to education  to child-rearing  to buying that first-time home  to dealing with medical emergencies.
nonapplause We have a partnership now.
nonapplause The group will work with the administration on making a down payment on the deficit.
nonapplause Free nations do not develop weapons of mass terror to threaten or blackmail the world.
nonapplause That's why I recently signed a bill that will create hundreds of thousands of opportunities for the American people to serve.
nonapplause And at the same time  while cutting a lot of spending and raising some taxes  almost all of which -- at least well over 70 percent of it comes from people with incomes above $100 000  and we tried to give a tax cut to people with families with incomes under $30 000 so they wouldn't have to pay a tax increase.
nonapplause Only God and the time and comfort you give to each other can do that.
nonapplause But it is expensive figuring out how to pay for it  and how to cover everybody so that they get the care they need is one of the important challenges we have.
nonapplause Yet there is no alternative.
nonapplause That's a cultural thing.
nonapplause When we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act last year  drastically reducing regulation  emphasizing more help to poor children in need  giving teachers and school principals more flexibility  it had bipartisan support.
nonapplause Would you stand up  Dr. Paine?
nonapplause Cliff retired from politics some years ago  but he's still going strong up in Jackson  and later this year he'll mark his 94th birthday.
nonapplause Indeed  it can create wider environmental damage because it involves quarrying limestone sometimes from the most beautiful areas of our countryside.
nonapplause So by going to work  I gave up my child's health care so that I could pay taxes to pay for the health care for people on welfare.
nonapplause Take the case of a homeowner.
nonapplause Only 2 percent of the Department of State personnel have been stationed in Africa.
nonapplause They felt so defeated they were talking about quitting.
nonapplause I've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards  and supporting teachers and principals  and turning around schools that aren't working  where students aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve.
nonapplause Your generation is something special.
nonapplause And I want to thank Dennis and all the members of this organization for allowing me to be here today.
nonapplause And more single parents are doing double duty alone.
nonapplause I say this because I think it is terribly important that we look to the future.
nonapplause And so I said  why don't we go ahead and come up with a system that says you're going to get your benefits if you're a poor person based upon wage increases  and if you're a wealthy person  you get your benefits that increase based upon the cost of living increases  and you scale it in between?
nonapplause And the Congress opens each day with prayer from its chaplains.
nonapplause The idea that we're just the big-spending party those days are over; we've shed that image  and we have to make sure we never get it again.
nonapplause The federal government has clearly lagged behind industry in making services available over the Internet.
nonapplause We don't like to be reminded of that  but it's true.
nonapplause Not staying at home because they think that somehow we are going to get in without them  not risking that.
nonapplause I wish you well with the rest of your conference.
nonapplause But to anyone who might feel doubtful or discouraged  I urge you to think about the history of this company.
nonapplause ﻿  Inaugural Address
nonapplause And there's a reason for that  and the reason is because on domestic issues he has been rated by the National Journal  an independent  nonpartisan group  probably does the most thorough and comprehensive analysis of members' voting records of any organization in Washington  he's been rated the most liberal member of the United States Senate.
nonapplause That's the state legislature.
nonapplause You know -- I assume that maybe some of you saw the debate last night.
nonapplause I want to describe to you what I consider to be the most wasteful administration in this century.
nonapplause You know what else they share?
nonapplause But I said what we really needed was to think about what we were going to do as a people  that we needed a new government  less bureaucratic  but more active; a new kind of politics that treated issues not as a way of dividing people  but as a way of solving problems together; a new set of common-sense ideas for the economy  for education  for crime  for welfare  for the environment  tied together by a simple philosophy: opportunity for every responsible American.
nonapplause Except for the interest run up between 1981 and 1992  our budget would be in balance today.
nonapplause Afghanistan has a National Assembly chosen by the Afghan people in free elections.
nonapplause In every State in the Union in the past 3 years  there has been a resurgence of interest in our schools and a resurgence of commitment to excellence.
nonapplause Instead of a reasoning argument about what will build America tomorrow  I hear a longing for yesterday.
nonapplause No  we need more to protect the hard-won achievements of these past 6 years.
nonapplause You may be brothers or sisters.
nonapplause Reform should begin with accountability  and reform should start at the top.
nonapplause In order to know what money is  as I've often told my children over the years  you have to stop to think about what it takes to bring it in.
nonapplause Our ultimate goal is to extend this initiative to 19 other African countries in Africa  forgiving more than $10 billion of additional debt.
nonapplause The principal alternative to democracy throughout history has  of course  been the consolidation of virtually all state power in the hands of a single strong man or small group who exercised that power without the informed consent of the governed.
nonapplause I should point out I'm not the only administration official present.
nonapplause The Congress shall pass no measure that slows growth  shrinks markets  or destroys jobs by erecting high tariffs or other trade barriers.
nonapplause And  obviously  we've all been impressed by the acts of heroism.
nonapplause But that doesn't mean that people aren't angry.
nonapplause Some would like us to depend on G. W. Bush or some other president -- they'll put good judges on the bench and then we'll get the kind of decisions we want.
nonapplause He was commanding officer of the aircraft carrier the U.S.S.
nonapplause Let me say  too  to all of you  I have been very honored to fight the battles that we have fought together  across party lines  for the Crime Bill  to end unfunded mandates.
nonapplause And we spend not only on retiree benefits  but we spend on every other program.
nonapplause He should use more Iraqi contractors and workers instead of big corporations like Halliburton.
nonapplause When Stephanie was introducing me  I learned something.
nonapplause Well  as these bases of power increase  it decreases Europe as a base of power.
nonapplause There is some value in brand names.
nonapplause And then in the Civil War  when slavery and sectionalism threatened one nation and Abraham Lincoln literally gave his life first for the union and second to get rid of slavery.
nonapplause His test is never soft sentiments  but hard results.
nonapplause But the solvency issue  you could solve it easily.
nonapplause Were I so tall as to reach the pole
nonapplause Thirty-seven thousand American troops proudly serve in Korea today.
nonapplause And when I saw pictures of some of you stacking sandbags in a blizzard  I thought that I had bad reception on my television at first.
nonapplause And with the leadership of Secretary LaHood and President Barack Obama  we're doing just that.
nonapplause And from my point of view  she's the only member of Congress from New York who speaks without an accent  and I like that.
nonapplause That's all we ask of you.
nonapplause If you want to see which job has more stress  this is the print on his introduction and this is the print on my card.
nonapplause But I think we've made a solid beginning on the difficult tasks of giving the government back to the people  a healthy economy back to free enterprise  and a strong defense back to the free world.
nonapplause We got here by getting rid of this deficit  getting interest rates down  getting it where people could invest and grow the economy.
nonapplause This year  I signed into law our Africa trade bill  and many of its champions are here with me from our Congress.
nonapplause The last point I want to make in this regard is that there are a lot of things we can do at the national level to deal with what I predict to you will be one of the three biggest issues of the next 40 years  which is how to do better at preserving the environment as we grow the economy.
nonapplause We will also expand the database on clinical trials of drugs that fight serious illnesses so that patients can keep track of their progress.
nonapplause With our hectic schedules  it wasn't always easily and  occasionally  wasn't possible.
nonapplause Do we know how to do aid  economic aid?
nonapplause And this is a much more important issue now than it was 10 years ago because of the global impacts of climate change.
nonapplause He said we can deal with the Iraqi situation by redeploying forces to Okinawa.
nonapplause Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations  including our own: we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary  and not a day more.
nonapplause One of the things we inherited when we came in  in the closing days of the Clinton administration  shortly before he left office  Bill Clinton designated huge areas in the West as roadless  permanently roadless  off-limits.
nonapplause What should she do?
nonapplause He's a good buddy.
nonapplause We can make this the safest big country in the world.
nonapplause Just like these ladies up here understand.
nonapplause It will also reduce harmful carbon pollution by 24 000 tons per year  which is the equivalent of removing 4 000 cars from our roads.
nonapplause The third thing I think we need is a wholesale assault on the inequalities of the world to share the benefits  and we know how to do it now.
nonapplause At a government level  I'd note that putting the G20 in the lead on global economic decision-making has brought more voices to the table -- including Turkey  Saudi Arabia  India and Indonesia.
nonapplause I make it because the legacy that you have is one that you must carry forward because this struggle is one that will not be ended even in my time.
nonapplause Bill of Rights  which created the VA Home Loan Guarantee Program.
nonapplause School breakfasts and lunches for the children of low-income families will continue  as will nutrition and other special services for the aging.
nonapplause And he went on to tell me that every member of the Senate represented something in the eyes of their state that was special and represented a piece of their state.
nonapplause We know that the toxic content of marijuana alone  for example  is roughly three times greater than it was 30 years ago.
nonapplause The effort to which I summon you will not be easy.
nonapplause The reason is that machines are doing the jobs of men  and we have not been able to find jobs for those men.
nonapplause And that when a child turns to violence  I came to realize that there's a hole in that boy's heart that no government alone can fill.
nonapplause We extended unemployment insurance to help folks get through these storms.
nonapplause And I want to begin just by thanking all of you who worked hard to minimize the damage of this flood.
nonapplause Today Ray Charles is known the world over for his infusion of gospel fervor into rhythm and blues and rock and roll and for the quality -- the sheer lilting  rolling musicial quality of his singing.
nonapplause He's a little young for the Oval Office.
nonapplause We're now running 40 percent ahead of schedule at less than half the predicted cost  in the midst of this economic boom  cleaning up our air  because we did it in a way that supported business  supported free markets  gave people the incentives to do the right thing  but said in the end we've got to give our children a cleaner environment.
nonapplause But one thing that I say we have in common is this: if we don't stand up to the principles of this party  we are making a terrible mistake.
nonapplause You could say that the only possible future for Israel is one of permanent siege  in which the ramparts hold and people stay alive  but the nation remains preoccupied with its very survival  subject to gnawing anxiety  limited in future achievement by the absence of real partnerships with your neighbors.
nonapplause I just repeated it for you.
nonapplause I think we ought to extend opportunity to the people and places that aren't part of the recovery.
nonapplause When other markets are growing  and other nations are competing  we've got to get even better.
nonapplause There is a drastic difference in how well the different states have done in identifying and enrolling their children.
nonapplause He'll come to Washington as an experienced public servant  and he'll be a congressman perfectly in tune with his district.
nonapplause Every Olympian stands at the starting block or at the beginning of a great game alone.
nonapplause We know from experience after experience after experience that the kind of violence that has unfortunately gripped the headlines in Florida in the last several days and grieved so many of us as Americans when people who come to our shores are hurt or killed when they want to see our country and they want to get to know the best about it  that is far from a problem of Florida alone.
nonapplause And we wanted all three agencies -- the French  the Brits  and the Americans -- to have thoroughly scrubbed this and to make sure that we were absolutely confident about the situation there.
nonapplause And he showed us how important it is that the men and women who make up small towns serve their communities with dignity and valor  as well as help define our national identity.
nonapplause I'm glad we've got the biggest drop in inequality among working people in the last two years we've seen in decades.
nonapplause You know  on that January 20th in 1981 that was no fresh-faced  well-fed baby that was left on our doorstep.
nonapplause But I do know this -- if I loaded up a truckload of hay  take it out on the prairie  and only one cow showed up  I'd feed her."
nonapplause It set us apart as a nation from the rest of the world  but brought us together as a people  around our shared belief in an ever-brighter future for our country.
nonapplause So thank you all very much for coming.
nonapplause I was glad to see the tribute paid to Evan Bayh and his leadership in Indiana.
nonapplause A son of Jack and Nelle Reagan never walked away from a battle on principle.
nonapplause The first test of this partnership was to clear debris.
nonapplause In a national competition  asking students to share their hopes for a peaceful Northern Ireland in letters to my husband  two students whom you see here tonight  Cathy Harte and Mark Lennox won the top prize.
nonapplause The great question of the 1960's is how the United States can maintain its position in the world  how we can increase our security  how we can live in peace  how we can hold out a helping hand to all those who wish to he free  and the decision which you must make as decisions of this country is which administration  which candidates  which party  are best associated with the great issues which are going to distinguish life in the sixties  particularly the fight for peace  particularly the fight against war  especially the fight for security?
nonapplause Through the work of scientists in your field  many farmers in developed nations are able to grow crops with high resistance to drought and pests and disease; enable farmers to produce far greater yields per acre.
nonapplause But this is the first time since the early 1960s when we had this kind of strong American economy  and we have no excuse for walking away from our responsibilities to the new markets of America.
nonapplause He's probably on his way to Denver.
nonapplause That's what Malcolm Wallop chose to do.
nonapplause We talked about a verse from my Bible  and they have a slightly different verse -- you know  many of the verses are the same.
nonapplause But it was a small state of tough-minded  but fair-minded people  and I thought if I could just get up there and stir around  I could do all right.
nonapplause So I say to you  this Senator  in a remarkably short period of time  has established herself as a national leader on the economy  on crime  on the environment  on immigration.
nonapplause They're seated somewhere in here  right now.
nonapplause And over the past seven years  they have conducted more than a hundred protests -- maids and hairdressers  vegetable sellers and seamstresses  taking to the streets; singing and dancing; banging on pots empty of food and brandishing brooms to express their wish to sweep the government clean.
nonapplause I won't be seeing Republicans or Democrats  I'll be seeing Americans.

nonapplause I was in northern California the other night  meeting with people who work for e-Bay.

nonapplause Our responsibilities are clear: We should try to make it easier for people to find good jobs by giving them the education and training they need to succeed.
nonapplause Now  here's what that commitment means: It means treating teachers like the professionals they are while also holding them more accountable -– in up to 150 more school districts.
nonapplause Well  we took that money out of the grasping hands of the Washington bureaucrats and put it back in the wallets of the people they'd taken it from in the first place: the hard-working men and women of America.
nonapplause Already  the refugee situation is building to unacceptable levels.
nonapplause Well  with the help of New Jersey leaders like Millicent Fenwick  Representative Roukema  Congressman Jim Courter  Senator Brady  Governor Kean  and others  we've tried to turn a few things around.

nonapplause This concern with values goes beyond just the issue of drugs  of course.
nonapplause This garden project  what we've done together  guys  has given us the opportunity not just to educate children  but to hopefully even educate a few parents and adults as we go along the way.
nonapplause Unfortunately I cannot do so.
nonapplause Our goal should be to make government the servant of the people and not the other way around.
nonapplause I'm very proud of the fact that our Small Business Administration --we cut the budget and doubled the loan volume.
nonapplause Today  because we acted  Iraq stands to be a force for good in the Middle East.
nonapplause "Well  why?"
nonapplause Meeting those challenges depends on education.
nonapplause We've had our share of bigotry.
nonapplause Again  I want to thank all of you for your service  and for the honor of being here.
nonapplause But more importantly  it produced hundreds of thousands of scientists and engineers  doctors and nurses -- the backbone of the largest middle class in history.
nonapplause By his repeated efforts to recast and redefine the war on terror and our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  Senator Kerry has given every indication that he lacks the resolve  the determination  and the conviction to prevail in the conflict we face.
nonapplause They oppose tax relief; now they're proposing massive increases in federal spending.
nonapplause That's called class warfare.
nonapplause But when these ideals are in retreat we are vulnerable.
nonapplause They know their job is to get results on behalf of the people.
nonapplause Now  everybody in this room who is over 40 years old  who studied economics was taught that the country ought to be in debt a little bit -- a little debt was a healthy thing.

nonapplause And five years ago  or over four years ago  I assembled 600 Arab American and Jewish American business people that said we will invest there when it's safe.
nonapplause People like Daniel Webster and folks who were able to stand up and give tongue with heartfelt conviction to an understanding of American life that would change the heart and shape the convictions of whole generations of our people.
nonapplause And that wasn't consistent with my experience.
nonapplause For example  consider the public servants I've nominated to carry out the people's business.
nonapplause And  before that  working with others who were in the Israeli government.

nonapplause So practice it.
nonapplause We were right to take command of the ship  to stop its aimless drift  and to get moving again.

nonapplause In other words  we live in a world now that is involved - is interdependent in every sense.
nonapplause Day after day the comrades called one another far from comradely names  and occasionally  when they remembered  they called us names too.
nonapplause Have you noticed that?
nonapplause I have listened to all of the speeches with the greatest possible interest  because there are some important decisions on higher and further education to be made during the next year.
nonapplause But their ideas are hopelessly old fashioned.
nonapplause Part of the important consideration here  as we look at questions of efficiency and of conservation  it's important for us to remember and for people to remember as they look at our forecast that we assume very significant savings in the area of conservation going forward.

nonapplause I say again  the American people don't know who -- or didn't before today -- know who Kathy Adams was.
nonapplause And I want to thank Mary and Frank  and little Connor  who I knew even before he was here.
nonapplause This is a wonderful occasion.
nonapplause But by competing in this event  you are sharpening the skills that have consistently moved our country forward.
nonapplause Nowhere was that clearer than the grants-in-aid program.
nonapplause Allow us to fulfill the dream of Harry Truman in 1948 that he laid out where we would no longer be the last industrial country on the face of the Earth without health insurance.

nonapplause They grew bolder in their belief that if they killed enough Americans  they could change American policy.
nonapplause We're all renewed by your vitality  by your ideals  and your focus on America's future.
nonapplause So what I can promise is that if you keep the discussion going  and if all of you keep fighting and organizing and standing up for the causes that we all share  then I know that together -- together -- we will keep moving forward  not just as women  but as Americans.
nonapplause Today  I have directed the Attorney General to develop a plan to create an award through executive action of the President to recognize public safety officers who have exhibited extraordinary valor.
nonapplause What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we have only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves  yet we rely on foreign countries for 53 percent of what we consume?

nonapplause When you look at those children who greeted us as we got off that plane today  how could anyone say they did not want those children to have a chance to have their own children?

nonapplause We reinvent the government.
nonapplause We don't have to wreck Medicare or Medicaid  or turn our backs on education or the environment.
nonapplause So  when I hear the first amendment used as a reason to keep the traditional moral values away from policymaking  I'm shocked.

nonapplause Thank you very much  Doc.
nonapplause So  we're turning on the gas.

nonapplause We all know we have a globalized economy but we have globalized information technology  globalized culture  tribal technology  the whole nine years.
nonapplause And it is a testament to the wisdom of our Founders that America remains deeply religious -– a nation where the ability of peoples of different faiths to coexist peacefully and with mutual respect for one another stands in stark contrast to the religious conflict that persists elsewhere around the globe.
nonapplause But if you think about it  how this is managed is an example of what will be a whole new set of questions about what the role of government should be.
nonapplause I consider this work that we did in Africa among the most important things I did in my eight years as president.
nonapplause Think about it.
nonapplause And today we're still working to give greater power and independence to State and local governments.
nonapplause But it's also emblematic for me of the many differences you don't see -- in susceptibility to heart disease  cancer  asthma and diabetes.
nonapplause That truth  for example  guides our new approach to Burma.
nonapplause We believe the fairest way is to ask every employer and every employee without health insurance to make some contribution.
nonapplause And this is a disease  as we know  that affects not just those diagnosed with it  and not just those who've survived it and those who've lost their lives to it  but it is a disease that also affects those who love and know them -- which these days seems like almost every single person in this country.
nonapplause And that brings me to the second part of this initiative: Let's move to ensure that all our families actually have access to the foods -- the healthy foods that they need in their own communities  because right now  23.5 million Americans  including 6.5 million children  live in what we call food deserts  and these are areas without access to a supermarket.
nonapplause But in fact that is not so  because the Royal Commission has now really set out the actual figures.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech at the Brookings Institution

nonapplause Unfortunately  the plan that they presented just weren't realistic.
nonapplause Mr. Vice President  good morning  and your comments about the economy and Dr. Feldstein's comments about the economy really laid out the strength of it  but let me add some numbers to that.
nonapplause We've already tried scaling back our investments in clean energy and education and innovation so that we could give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations  and that didn't work.

nonapplause A slowdown that began a year ago or more  that's carried on through into 2001  and was quite possibly headed for recessionary levels before September 11th.
nonapplause We're talking about people's lives.
nonapplause These things have a great deal to do with your future and the future of America.
nonapplause But I think the evidence is in  and you need to think about that in terms of Hillary's race  the Vice President's race  every other race this year.
nonapplause And you could have in five or six decades a substantial part of the Everglades under water if we don't aggressively move to try to reverse this.
nonapplause But you came here tonight because we're raising money for the elections of 2000.
nonapplause The steel strike ten years ago—backed by Labour.
nonapplause That is the challenge.
nonapplause And back in '94  when we had this big fight about it  we had a big fight because the economy was bad and there was no way to cover everybody except with an employer mandate  which couldn't pass because the economy was bad  or with more money which we didn't have unless we raised taxes  and we couldn't do it because we just raised taxes to get the deficit down.
nonapplause So  in that sense  the governors and the mayors who are here are profoundly important people.
nonapplause It's up to us to recognize our veterans not just for all they've done for this country -- but for all they will continue to do for this country.
nonapplause And these community colleges all across our country are open to people of all ages looking for a way to better themselves.
nonapplause Nothing changed in the closeness of their lives and the impact they had on one another except whether it was positive or negative.
nonapplause And don't anyone decide your vote isn't needed and stay home.
nonapplause But what we hope to do here is to energize you to talk to those last few members of the House we need to put this bill over the top; to tell them this is not about gun control  it's about crime control.

nonapplause After the sacrifice he made for this country in World War II  he could have been forgiven if he never hit another lick for his country.
nonapplause Keep it that way.
nonapplause No nation in our time has entered the fast track of development without first opening up its economy to world markets.
nonapplause You hire people to make good decisions  to make your life better  to give you the tools to make the most of your own lives and you hire people to look to the future and come up with leadership ideas that may not be accepted when they're first floated but that have merit  that are right and that in the end are going to prevail if you give the people who are advocating them the chance to serve long enough to do it.
nonapplause I then asked him to serve as the Deputy Chief of Staff.
nonapplause And I love him very much.
nonapplause And that process of making the system work smarter and better so that we're all leading healthier lives  and that the states and federal governments aren't bankrupted -- that's going to take a lot of work.
nonapplause And Minority Leader Senator Jones and all the members of the legislature  I thank you.

nonapplause I've come to admire Adam Putnam.

nonapplause And the grace and dignity of their lives is part of the story of black music in America.
nonapplause However  we wish that a Head of Government  a Foreign Minister  a Minister for Internal Affairs  a Minister for Economics  a Minister for Agriculture would for once have the courage to speak so openly.
nonapplause Whatever slogans they chant  when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes.
nonapplause That's what what you do at Hyde Park ought to be.
nonapplause We have almost -- the welfare rolls are about half the size they were when I took office.
nonapplause But I will tell you I also care deeply about the lies that have been told when people stand up and say a heartless government bureaucracy  through a welfare program that has destroyed families  destroyed the character of children through education that undermines sexual responsibility is the answer to our needs.
nonapplause But I'm telling you -- and I'd like to sort of ride off into the sunset singing "Happy Trails."

nonapplause In one of Senator Kerry's recent observations about foreign policy  he informed his listeners that he's met with unnamed foreign leaders who support him.
nonapplause Fewer men on fewer acres than any nation on earth - but free men on free acres can produce here in North America all the food that a hungry world could use - while all the collective farms and forced labor of the communist system produce one shortage after another.
nonapplause In 1911  the top one per cent of the population owned 69 per cent of the wealth.
nonapplause And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system  unemployment might be double what it is today.
nonapplause You don't have freedom of worship.
nonapplause I welcome Congressman Bono who was  before he became a congressman  a mayor and  therefore  has an intimate personal experience with this whole issue.
nonapplause As the Vice President used to say on the campaign trail  everything that should be down was up  everything that should be up was down.
nonapplause And as I was walking away the father said  "Mr. President  don't you ever think it doesn't matter what goes on up here.

nonapplause Churchill also said this  and he directed it at the people of his country who were looking for any way to avoid having to really confront the threat that he was warning of and asking them to prepare for.
nonapplause It will attract bugs.
nonapplause We saw the signs all around us.
nonapplause Tommy Lasorda  perhaps you best summed up this year's Dodger season when you said  after it was all over  "This just shows what can happen when you want something bad enough."
nonapplause We will deepen our support for those grass-roots efforts  for the development projects which are bridging divisions and clearing a path to a better future.
nonapplause And we replaced them with a new set of ideas that have now come to be called the Third Way  because they've been embraced not just here in America  but increasingly all across the world by people who were trying to break out of outmoded political and economic and social arrangements to deal with the real challenges of the 21st century.
nonapplause So that means it wasn't her choice  was it?
nonapplause But in our own household  with all the privileges and opportunities that we have  there are times -- look  there are times when kids slack off.
nonapplause And so I believe we're making progress on changing the tone in Washington  D.C.
nonapplause The choice before the American people this year is just as clear as it was in 1980 and 1984: a choice between  on the one hand  policies of tax and spend  economic stagnation  international weakness  accommodation  and from Grenada to Libya  always  always "blame America first"; and  on the other hand  the policies of limited government  economic growth  individual opportunity  a strong defense  firmness with the Soviets  and always  always  "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States."
nonapplause This is one of the highest honors a President can bestow.
nonapplause And we've learned this again with the recent outbreak of the H1N1 virus.
nonapplause That's better than I did when I was in college.
nonapplause And we ought to enact real campaign finance reform.
nonapplause I understand -- I understand Senator John Kerry is in Ohio today  too.

nonapplause Well  I know you join me in a prayer today that for America such days and places are gone forever; that as much as we honor those who died to make us free  we also fervently hope that such sacrifice will never again have to be asked for  and that the day is not far off when there will be no new battlefields to visit and no old soldiers stories to hear.

nonapplause The Nation States of the world  in general  are moving toward greater cooperation on security and other areas.
nonapplause Don't you think that we're far better off building a bridge to the future than a bridge to the past?
nonapplause And  again  I have to say to you we have a representative government that represents the will and the desires of the people.
nonapplause I know I want that for my girls.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President and the First Lady at International Women's Day Reception
nonapplause Consider mercury  an extremely toxic pollutant causing severe developmental and neurological defects in developing fetuses and in children and in adults.
nonapplause Of course not.
nonapplause Lower personal rates means lower house loans  lower car loans  lower college loans  lower credit card payments; a longer  more protracted  more prosperous future for America.
nonapplause And most important  if you do this  you will say  we're going to treat this area of our life like every other area of our national life.
nonapplause So tonight  we honor the prodigy  who became a prophet  for using his divine gifts to move the world to sing and to act.
nonapplause What we need to do is sort of erase the whole concept of unemployment and develop one of reemployment.
nonapplause But as Theodore Roosevelt once put it  I'm asking you to “Do what you can  with what you've got  where you are.” And I can guarantee that wherever your journey takes you  there are going to be children who need mentors and senior citizens who need assistance  folks down on their luck who could use a helping hand.
nonapplause And they don't want that to happen.
nonapplause Casual drug use  especially marijuana  among young teenagers -- not young adults  among teenagers -- is up.

nonapplause And in case there's still any doubt  I want you to know we will preserve that part of the American dream.
nonapplause There are a lot of misconceptions about Mexico.
nonapplause Keep in mind  in 6 000 years of human history  this happened 57 years ago  but because of the cold war  it wasn't possible.
nonapplause Our prosperity is based on sound fundamentals: increased production by individuals in the world's most dynamic and freest economy.
nonapplause We cut tax rates  indexed tax brackets  then simplified the entire tax system with our historic tax reform.
nonapplause But that's true whether you're an attorney  a paralegal  a librarian  a support staffer -- truly  the dedication that you've all shown is extraordinary.
nonapplause For all practical purposes  if I want to increase the amount of money  for example  we spend on Head Start in Pennsylvania by a million dollars  we have to cut something else by a million dollars.
nonapplause All of those things.
nonapplause HHS will offer these fellowships beginning in September of 1998 to promising students enrolled in bioethics graduate programs.
nonapplause The discretionary spending at the end of last year increased by 8 percent.
nonapplause "Iraq's WMD" -- weapons of mass destruction -- "Iraq's WMD programs spanned more than two decades  involved thousands of people  billions of dollars  and was elaborately shielded by security and deception operations that continued even beyond the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom."

nonapplause I see Deputy Secretary Garamendi and there are many others here from the Interior Department.
nonapplause Today  more than 4.6 million Afghan refugees have come home -- one of the largest return movements in history.
nonapplause And when life is all said and done  the stories we really will be thinking about in our last moments were who liked us and who loved us and what moved us  and the springtimes we remember  and the moments of personal drama and courage and meaning that came into our lives.
nonapplause Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.
nonapplause Number one  accelerate all the marginal tax-rate reductions already approved by the Congress.
nonapplause To revive the economy and set a platform for economic growth  we lowered marginal tax rates and reduced multiple taxation on investment.
nonapplause May this partnership grow from strength to strength in our common endeavors for justice  economic prosperity  and a healthier environment for all our people.
nonapplause As you know  the President has said that America is facing some of the greatest challenges it's faced in generations  and as a result  Washington can only do so much.
nonapplause Do your duty.
nonapplause It's how you'll make a difference in the life of our nation.
nonapplause And that is why  in a way  we have had such a debate on television and radio about whether we should cut tax.
nonapplause We have an interest in ensuring the security of our citizens living and working in Haiti.

nonapplause So when they get it  they get it when it's too late  too expensive  at the emergency room.
nonapplause Their parents have made that choice at great cost and sacrifice.
nonapplause Secretary of Education Bill Bennett tells me that wherever you find parents and communities who care -- principals who set goals and keep track of progress  teachers who pay attention to basics  and students who work hard -- in those places you find America's great school systems.
nonapplause As we remain firm in our objectives  we'll be flexible in our approach.
nonapplause Once again  I want to thank you all of you for your commitment to the cause we share.
nonapplause And we need to think about this.
nonapplause Today  37 years later  after inflation during the 1970's eroded the value of the dollar and made it so much more expensive to raise children or care for elderly parents  the personal exemption has risen all the way to  well  just to $1 040.
nonapplause They helped us to plant and to harvest.
nonapplause I look forward to working with the Congress to achieve all these goals.
nonapplause But to continue to be true to those values  we have to have a clear vision of the future and we have to stick with it.
nonapplause Thank you all very much.
nonapplause Washington is running up the biggest deficits in the history of our nation.
nonapplause One is  I agree with the economic policy he's articulated.
nonapplause There is no country in the world better positioned than the United States for the 21st century.
nonapplause I understand there is still an enemy which lurks out there.
nonapplause That's at the heart of our efforts  and clean energy can be a powerful engine for creating that kind of growth.
nonapplause And you hired them  so they should want to know if you're going to win  right?
nonapplause The policies we need to change have been in place for a good long while nationally.
nonapplause I think it is very important that you make up your mind what you think the choices are and what the consequences will be  and that you share them with others.
nonapplause You can help to implant values into children who aren't getting them in other places.
nonapplause And countries are no different than people.
nonapplause I hope it will be the first step in America resuming a path of responsible leadership toward the environmental future we will increasingly share with our neighbors all across the globe.
nonapplause Greetings to all of you.
nonapplause Both Jeb and Charlie support pay increases for soldiers  and included a 2.7 percent raise for all members of the armed services in the most recent National Defense Authorization bill.
nonapplause Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means  and that the President should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants -- provided it is a President with whom they agree.
nonapplause I visited with some of them in the hospitals and I am stunned by their commitment  by their sense of duty  their patriotism.
nonapplause The American people have a bottom line that's measured in their own reality: are they safer?
nonapplause Such a bargain can be at the heart of our collective efforts to convince Iran  for example  to forego the development of nuclear weapons.
nonapplause I'm sharing with you an understanding that I have of myself  why I'm here  why I've done some of the things that I've done  and why  over the last several years -- I was  I think  one of the more vocal critics of Bill Clinton that existed in the country.
nonapplause In my heart  I know we have that faith.
nonapplause Destroy it  and you have severed that connection.
nonapplause And I think we've held America together many  many times  as other generations will do that follow us.
nonapplause Even in the hardest times  against the toughest odds  we've never given in to pessimism; we've never surrendered our fates to chance; we have endured; we have worked hard; we sought out new frontiers.
nonapplause No one thinks we have really built one America.
nonapplause Already  every step forward has been tempered with pain.
nonapplause When we came into office  discretionary spending rose 8.7 percent that year.

nonapplause Fortunately  we don't have to look back too many years to see how their agenda turns out.
nonapplause It increases the number of vet centers and mobile health clinics  expanding access to this needed care in rural areas.
nonapplause And that costs business about $50 billion a year.
nonapplause This year we've proposed legislation that will consolidate over $22 billion of spending in 34 programs into four block grants.
nonapplause Thank you all for being here.
nonapplause Reducing demand may be less dramatic and newsworthy than arresting traffickers but without customers the drug traffickers would soon be out of business.
nonapplause Stan wasn't known for idle words  so I took his advice to heart and ran instead for the U.S. House of Representatives.

nonapplause Finally  as I announced yesterday  I've asked Frank Carlucci to become the new Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.
nonapplause You have to bend over backwards to avoid getting in the way of people's legitimate exercise of their religious convictions.
nonapplause So you've got to be patient and help people become patient with you.
nonapplause There's a world of opportunity ahead if we can only break away from the logjam of the past.
nonapplause It was one where we spend more on health care than any other nation but aren't any healthier; where we've been slow to invest in clean energy technologies that have created new jobs and new industries in other countries because we've been slow to take up the call of clean energy.
nonapplause Fifth  in the resolution of remaining differences  whether they come today or after several years of heartbreak and bloodshed  the fundamental  painful  but necessary choices will almost certainly remain the same whenever the decision is made.
nonapplause First  this country  if we are to keep the peace must continue to be the strongest nation in the world.
nonapplause We do it for the people of Bosnia  for the stability of Europe  for American leadership and for the values we hold dear.
nonapplause But anyway  there it is.
nonapplause I mean  why do you think we're around here after over 220 years?
nonapplause But for such an outcome to be possible  we need to have the Soviets return to the bargaining table.
nonapplause When I ran for President  I promised that when the United States of America puts its name to an agreement  that agreement will be as good for workers as it is for businesses  including strong labor and environmental protections that we'll enforce.
nonapplause This is an amazing set of topics.
nonapplause This nation cannot simply ignore the suffering of oppressed peoples and remain true to our basic strengths and principles.
nonapplause Well  in three and a half years  the American people have produced over 10 million jobs  3.7 million new homeowners  three years in a row of record new small business starts  the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years.
nonapplause This Saturday  America will put behind us the ingratitude and injustice of the past.
nonapplause And that alliance has in fact been the salvation of Europe and must be kept alive into the next century.
nonapplause The issue is controversial  so we have to have a national consensus on both the nature of the problem and the direction we must take.
nonapplause Today  America leads a worldwide coalition that is sharing intelligence  hunting down terrorists and freezing the assets of terrorist groups and front organizations.
nonapplause 13 -- anything to get more tax dollars.
nonapplause What we need is one of those things that happens when the American people  you out there  organize and take your organizations and come together in a movement that says to Washington: "This is what we want."
nonapplause The challenges are too great.
nonapplause It ought to be easy to figure out which.
nonapplause This is a much better organization than I've ever been associated with.
nonapplause Throughout this century  bitterness between the Palestinian and Jewish people has robbed the entire region of its resources  its potential  and too many of its sons and daughters.

nonapplause And we must do this at a time when automation is throwing men out of work.

nonapplause Dr. King always said  "The black man needs the white man to free him of his fear  and the white man needs the black man to free him of his guilt."
nonapplause I think it's a good thing you're here tonight  not a bad thing  and I'm proud of you for doing it.
nonapplause At Notre Dame a while ago  I gave a speech that talked about how our nation can be a more compassionate country.
nonapplause The second is to say that -- as Suzanne said so eloquently -- we're in a lot better shape than we used to be  but nowhere near where we ought to be.
nonapplause That can be a good thing.
nonapplause And as we look to the future  we want our children and grandchildren to know the same freedom and opportunity  the same greatness of spirit that we as Americans have cherished.
nonapplause So the pattern is very clear.
nonapplause Because it was just part of their strategy  and it continued for quite a long time.
nonapplause We must end this march of folly.
nonapplause And I think it is rather good that Americans are having another opportunity to see Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues in the Communist world as they come to the United States.
nonapplause And so she was promptly subjected to a mock trial and sentenced to the penitentiary for ten years.
nonapplause Within four years  when I graduated from college  it was two days after Senator Kennedy was killed; two months after Martin Luther King was killed; nine weeks after President Johnson  the great civil rights President  couldn't even run for reelection because the country was so divided over Vietnam.
nonapplause That was a great day.
nonapplause I'm here to tell you I understand that fear.
nonapplause What finally caught my eye  however  and what we have to spend some time thinking through so that we will understand  not just the significance of the decision I have taken  but the significance of this election overall  what we have to look at is what finally arrested my attention and forced me to consider whether I not only had the opportunity to oppose him  but the obligation.
nonapplause One of the traits these days that is considered morally significant is the ability to enjoy life.
nonapplause What are we all supposed to do to get from where we are  to where we'd like to go?
nonapplause You inspire us to believe that lasting peace is obtainable and attainable  and that we will reach our goal.
nonapplause The lessons of September the 11th  2001  are indelibly etched in my mind.
nonapplause This area has been hit with a perfect storm of economic troubles.
nonapplause The kinds of jobs for which the public schools must be preparing California's students.
nonapplause Yes  we can have a nuclear freeze  just as soon as we have negotiated nuclear weapons down to a verifiable  equal level on both sides -- then we'll have a nuclear freeze.
nonapplause And in the beginning almost all of them drew pictures of the tragedy  and then as time went on  almost all of them moved onto other things  and those who didn't were the ones that needed special assistance.
nonapplause We hope the Soviets are prepared to join us to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons.
nonapplause I said at the time that we have to rethink our policies and set standards of accountability  and now we're paying the price for not doing that.
nonapplause So again let me say  I thank you all.
nonapplause As I say  there was a time when something of this kind -- I could only participate by telephone.
nonapplause Will you get your friends and neighbors also to vote?
nonapplause Another -- and this shows the spirit out here -- had a note on top.
nonapplause We have a third-party system -- a third-party payer system.
nonapplause I've been battling a big cold today.
nonapplause On September the 11th  the world saw once again the true meaning of heroism.
nonapplause But while significant individual reforms have been made -- such as Medicare  Medicaid  and the Children's Health Insurance Program -- efforts at comprehensive reform that covers everyone and brings down costs have largely failed.
nonapplause But we all make mistakes.
nonapplause The faith is the same the whole time.
nonapplause Ted Kennedy --
nonapplause It is now clear that in order to do that  more than ever before  Americans must seek their own opportunities to improve their lives through education and training and that it must happen over the course of a lifetime.
nonapplause Our current troubles were born of eroding home values and portfolio values  but also an erosion of our common values.
nonapplause We must plug the holes in the boat of open markets and free trade and set sail again in the direction of prosperity.
nonapplause So it is  by definition  not completely satisfying.
nonapplause Thank you  Governor Deukmejian  Senator and Mrs. Wilson  and Barbara and Mr. Vice President.
nonapplause ﻿  President Participates in Opening Ceremony for Air Force One Pavilion
nonapplause Throughout the Baltic States  Eastern Europe and Asia  now in Africa and Latin America  nation after nation has fallen prey to an ideology that seeks to stifle all that's good about the human spirit  even as it attempts to justify Communist rule.
nonapplause In recent years  that obligation has sometimes been neglected.
nonapplause In the last Congress we were able to get a big downpayment on my plan for 100 000 more teachers in the early grades to take the average size of the classes down to 18 across America in the first three grades.

nonapplause I thank you for keeping up the struggle.
nonapplause Tax rates have been cut.

nonapplause DuLaughter.)
nonapplause And when you see them  you find that you look more like them than you look like Sam.
nonapplause Seven hundred people.
nonapplause And they are vital to the security of our country.
nonapplause This decision has effects which also impinge potentially religious liberties.
nonapplause If so  I'm an extremist and so are the great majority.
nonapplause And what they talked about was how the computer revolution and our attempt to decode the human gene go together  and how we couldn't have done the genetic work without the computer work.
nonapplause This fall  we will host the APEC ministerial meeting in Seattle.
nonapplause We brought interest rates to the lowest level in a decade  inflation to the lowest in a quarter of a century.
nonapplause And so we all need to recognize that we can't resolve all these identity conflicts overnight.
nonapplause That is not to be taken for granted any more.
nonapplause So anyway  I just finished this book  on my life  it was awful.
nonapplause No  we focus on the health care of the citizens of this country.
nonapplause And in all kinds of ways.
nonapplause You know  when I think of them sometimes  and particularly the opposition that wants to do those ridiculous things  I think of those three fellows that came out of a building one day and found they'd locked themselves out of their car.
nonapplause We should be for cooperation.
nonapplause In the past election  I talked about five important values -- family  neighborhood  work  peace  and freedom.
nonapplause It gave another big tax cut heavily tilted to upper-income people.
nonapplause How are you going to pay for the shoes and the clothing and the housing?
nonapplause We went through a period in the '60s where  if you like  people just sort of said  well  you do your own thing.
nonapplause So that's important for medical research for the development of new therapies.
nonapplause You are the guardians of a million dreams.
nonapplause I want to express my appreciation to two of their representatives who joined us -- Congressman Ehlers from Michigan and Congressman Moran from Virginia.
nonapplause They also demonstrate something about the character of our President.
nonapplause Ours is not a negative administration trying to turn back the clock.
nonapplause And the candidate looked around for a podium to give his speech from -- the only thing he could find was a pile of that stuff that Bess Truman took 35 years trying to get Harry to call fertilizer.
nonapplause Reverend William Moore  who organized parents and educators and other clergy in North Philadelphia to provide safety corridors for kids going to and from school.
nonapplause No weapon -- no matter how powerful -- can erase the hatred that lies in someone's heart.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the Community Of Kisowera School
nonapplause I don't think the fiercely independent people of Nevada want as their Senator a tax-and-spend liberal  who is against a balanced budget amendment.
nonapplause As has already been said  ever since 1910  when William Boyce founded the Boy Scouts of America  every President has proudly served as your honorary President.
nonapplause We owe a debt to all who serve.
nonapplause As Mr. Andropov put it when asked whether he would agree to one-sided disarmament  "We are not a naive people".
nonapplause That has been the impetus behind this administration's constant support of such projects as Burns Creek  to push ahead on feasible starts and develop their potential.
nonapplause In 2001  I spoke to the American people and set forth a new policy on stem cell research that struck a balance between the needs of science and the demands of conscience.
nonapplause And I've been meeting with educators and school nutrition leaders  people like Mary Hill  asking them to do their part to make sure you all have options that not only are healthy but they taste good and they look good and it looks like something that you event want to try.
nonapplause Mr. President  I have always maintained that when the job to be done is really rough  the horse cavalry can provide the man to do it.
nonapplause We are playing catch-up in some areas where we appear to enjoy the lead.
nonapplause I think the answer lies less in ideological prescriptions than it does in practical applications of the circumstances we face.
nonapplause It harkens back to the President's experience in Texas.
nonapplause We're a people of revolution; who value hard work and sacrifice; who forever look forward to the future with a deep and abiding faith that the dream of opportunity is still real and alive in our time.

nonapplause But here's the main point I want you to know.

nonapplause I for one was very sad that we could not  having had it discussed at two European Councils  be more explicit about the VAT proposals which the Commission has put forward  which raises the VAT threshold on turnover at the option of each country to £ 25 000  and also simplifies the VAT returns for small businesses who have a turnover up to about £ 110 000—all practical measures which we were trying to push ahead but other countries do not find themselves able fully to accept that yet.
nonapplause You can volunteer to help watch neighborhoods.
nonapplause So I think  derived from a rediscovery of our essential values -- the belief in community  opportunity and responsibility as being the basis for that -- a derivation from those values in the economic  the social  the government  and the international sphere  adds up to practical policies in the end.
nonapplause We had to get a fairer balance of benefits and payments in the European Community.
nonapplause There are so many things that might divide us--race and creed and background and nationality and ethnicity.
nonapplause They may not be rich or powerful in the traditional sense.
nonapplause This is America's story.
nonapplause I know I couldn't face a throng this large without knowing that many of you are Democrats and many of you also were Democrats and changed  including me -- I was one  too.
nonapplause I have confidence in the future of this country  because we're a country full of such decent and courageous and loving people.
nonapplause Now  if you think all of our problems are personal and cultural  that really let's you off the hook -- you don't have to do much heavy lifting.
nonapplause In 1958  every Republican in the key Education and Labor Committee voted against aid for school construction  and in 1960  when we tried again to provide aid for the construction of public school classrooms  67 percent of all the Republicans in the House voted against it  and all four Republicans in the House Rules Committee joined together with two unwise Democrats - and we have some of them - all four of the Republicans joined together to kill the bill from ever getting to the floor of the House.
nonapplause He didn't think that was a good answer.
nonapplause We've had experience in dealing with them and on the basis of that knowledge these are the things we can and must do as a country.
nonapplause But I've got pollsters.
nonapplause We've encouraged businesses to take root and grow in neglected communities.
nonapplause You may remember that awful incident when it happened.
nonapplause Now how would we go about doing that?
nonapplause We cannot have the United States walk away from one of the greatest moral challenges in postwar history.
nonapplause We're providing textbooks for classrooms.
nonapplause Much of the tension stems from the idea that religion is simply not welcome at all in what Professor Carter at Yale has called the public square.
nonapplause The work is still difficult.
nonapplause So we reached a bipartisan agreement that instead of just expanding Medicaid  we would allow the states to build and design these programs and enroll the children.
nonapplause It's great to be back in Oklahoma.
nonapplause It means that we need more robust consumer and investor protections.
nonapplause Steve Symms and I know that our greatest days are still ahead.
nonapplause We'll have a great victory in November.
nonapplause Any new taxes in this ideology are of course bad  especially if they add anything at all to the already unbearable burden placed on the wealthy and powerful.
nonapplause This is the largest two-year increase in history.
nonapplause We've never heard an explanation of that  we never shall.
nonapplause So  what do our critics want?
nonapplause And  lamentably  she's right about that.
nonapplause Once again  I want to thank all of you for your commitment to the cause we all share.
nonapplause We can do it because we saw with our Olympic athletes that when our people pull out all the steps -- the stops  I should say -- to meet a challenge  nothing can hold America back.
nonapplause When we play golf he hits the ball longer than I do.
nonapplause Our problem has been increasing incomes.
nonapplause Let me say that in the last few months especially  we have been very active in dealing with those who commit crimes against children  especially those who commit sexual offenses children.
nonapplause You know  you've got three choices in your health care plan.
nonapplause Union members have been delighted by our trade union reforms.
nonapplause But it is a big part of why our economy has produced almost 12 million jobs in the last four years and one month  including over 1 million new jobs in construction.
nonapplause They have produced an episode more shameful  perhaps  than any in the history of the country.
nonapplause We have a Tylenol taxation situation here  and we have "Reagan-mortis" setting in to the Nation's body politic.
nonapplause The third thing I want to say is this.
nonapplause They are beautiful  they are inquisitive -- yes  it was a hug  it was a good hug.
nonapplause We stopped rewarding responsibility and work and rigged the game of economic life against the broad American middle class.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by President Obama  President Mubarak  His Majesty King Abdullah  Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas Before Working Dinner
nonapplause But we cannot reduce the deficit by raising taxes.
nonapplause They can then achieve their growth with minimum damage to the environment without going through the phase of the dark satanic mills.
nonapplause We went from one of the largest 2-year increases ever in prices that farmers paid in '79 and '80 to the smallest 2-year rise in 15 years in 1982 and '83.
nonapplause It's great to be in Gulfport  and greetings to all of you who come from the delta  the home of the outstanding Congressman Webb Franklin.
nonapplause I know that I have to move on now to where I'm to speak  but I want to thank you all  and God bless you all.
nonapplause We are also united in believing we have to build one America.
nonapplause This is true.
nonapplause But good afternoon  and I am delighted and honored to be here to celebrate with you.
nonapplause I do think we need to make it clear  every single day  we're not an occupying power and we have no intention of staying permanently.
nonapplause That liberal gang we replaced 5\1/2\ years ago used every problem -- like the ones confronting the energy business -- as an excuse to increase Federal spending  raise your taxes  and expand the power of the Washington bureaucracy.
nonapplause The House of Representatives has already approved that new department.
nonapplause I would love it if it happened on every issue.
nonapplause And we heard a lot more last night about how we can make still more progress as we prepare our nation for the 21st century.
nonapplause And we yet have to get at the discrimination against working wives in social security and some other things.
nonapplause When only one out of 10 engineers is a woman  and only 30 percent of those in math and computer science jobs are women  we simply have to do more.
nonapplause That was free enterprise in action: as well as genuine jobs  it provided practical help for the young and the old and others in need.
nonapplause I now know that there is something fundamentally different about the role of education in this time than in any other time.
nonapplause We know when children are learning.
nonapplause But I believe it's in the hearts and minds of most Americans.
nonapplause He said  "I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it."
nonapplause But notice the difference: While democracy seeks equality in liberty  socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude."
nonapplause Let me thank the good people of Frontiers of Freedom  of course  George Landrith  Kerri Houston  Al Lee  for bringing us all together this evening.
nonapplause To my mind  Senator Denton is nothing less than a national treasure.
nonapplause If we ever get through the thicket of problems  political and otherwise  to the end of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  I'm convinced that a lot of it will come because of efforts of Israelis and others working in their private capacity  as well as from government policy.
nonapplause The University of Michigan was established around 1837  and it was financed by lands of this State to support education.
nonapplause And with each passing day  the terrorists can be confident they will sustain more.
nonapplause A lot of people have this idea that  well  if you were really a future-oriented person it means you're too material or you're too concerned about ideas  and that's very exciting  but you must be a little shy on the traditional ideals and values that have kept our country strong.
nonapplause None of this will come easy  nor without setback or struggle.
nonapplause And most importantly  it will create thousands of jobs -- good jobs  by the way  that can't be outsourced; jobs that will last and jobs that pay a decent wage.
nonapplause There's a good reason why so many people are coming here.
nonapplause The number of people without health insurance is down for the first time in 12 years  thanks to the Children's Health Insurance Program.
nonapplause We want true energy independence  and we need a political consensus to arrive at it.
nonapplause And we're making progress.
nonapplause So at one time in my life I was a baseball person.
nonapplause The good things that have happened in this country in the last eight years are nothing compared to what all of us together could achieve in the next eight or ten years if  but only if  we make the right choices about our future.
nonapplause But in Kosovo  our power was exercised in alliance with Europe  in pursuit of our shared interest in European peace and stability  in defense of shared values central to the goal of European integration.
nonapplause And men like Ralph Regula  Mike DeWine  George Voinovich -- you've got some superb members in the Congress.
nonapplause By 1996  we were reelected  and with a much bigger margin of victory in Louisiana -- thank you very much -- because it wasn't an argument anymore  it was an established fact.
nonapplause But it's not just the work that you do that makes this place so special.
nonapplause The Congress is going to send me two measures that this caucus has worked hard on for a long time -- the minimum wage bill  which also has some important help for small businesses  incentives to invest more in the business and to make it easier to take out retirement plans; and  of course  the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill  which will help millions of Americans have access to health care.
nonapplause But you should be sobered by the important responsibilities you are about to assume.
nonapplause It changed everything.
nonapplause Filmmakers like Milos Forman have challenged our imagination.
nonapplause They helped us till the soil.
nonapplause Right over there.
nonapplause With that triumph Peru proclaimed its independence and a new era began in our hemisphere.
nonapplause And the third thing I wanted to do is to make sure that in this new world our country continues to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity.
nonapplause We knew that our national military defense had been weakened.
nonapplause Some cut down on the dosage  to make a bottle of pills last longer.
nonapplause and against it.
nonapplause We are also committed to delegating as much responsibility as possible to heads and governors of schools.
nonapplause So there's ample evidence there that it works and it will  in fact  produce the desired result.
nonapplause The surplus is supposed to be $2 trillion.
nonapplause and what are they marching for?
nonapplause In the Middle East  we are encouraging free markets  democracy  and tolerance -- because these are the ideas and the aspirations that overcome violence  and turn societies to the pursuit of peace.
nonapplause I say we cannot afford not to have an e-rate.
nonapplause For many years prior to 9/11  we treated terror attacks against Americans as isolated incidents and answered  if at all  on an ad hoc basis -- never in a systematic way.
nonapplause He stalked into my office  and he declared  "Giving that money back is an unnecessary expenditure of public funds."
nonapplause You need to tell them just what I told you.
nonapplause Your present Congressman and I know your next Congressman  Ken Gray  your present Senator and I know your your next U.S.
nonapplause It looks like we've got somebody who might've fainted down there  so if we've got a medic.
nonapplause Listen to what John C. Calhoun had to say about him.
nonapplause I've also been struck by how many times we end up taking a different path than the one we set out on.
nonapplause I've also had a wonderful time traveling your beautiful state.
nonapplause By then  you've been around for more than 10 years  your picture has been on television  name has been in the newspapers  and all the door-to-door work and the rallies and the barbecues and the town meetings and so forth.
nonapplause It's a question of candidates  it's a question of organization  and it's a question of emphasis up and down the line.
nonapplause So they were trying to divide and subtract.
nonapplause And for me it is a personal priority of the highest order.
nonapplause We've created a White House Office of Homeland Security  led by former Governor Tom Ridge  to answer the threat with better detection and prevention and preparedness and response capability.
nonapplause When the President arrived in Washington three years ago  he was determined to solve problems  instead of simply pass them on to future generations.
nonapplause Clearly  the call for change that Jefferson made he intended to be echoed generation after generation after generation.
nonapplause The sense of timelessness is so strong in this beautiful place it is easy to forget the story of Perouges is also the story of change.
nonapplause Even then  they won't pay for it.
nonapplause And we passed a responsible environmental law called the Healthy Forests Act to improve forest health and to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire across the West.
nonapplause A vengeful ex-con in Cape Fear.
nonapplause And the President's plan to address the home mortgage crisis is going to help rural families refinance their mortgages  modify loans and secure loans with more affordable monthly payments.
nonapplause I know that he's said he's changed his mind on this  that now he supports the President on the Formosa Straits  that really he didn't mean this business about apologizing and regretting  and as far as Cuba is concerned  he was misunderstood.
nonapplause We got married and I didn't have a nickel to my name.
nonapplause In our own hemisphere we've seen a freedom tide sweep over South and Central America.
nonapplause The marker says that the distances from Warsaw to Moscow and Warsaw to Brussels are equal.

nonapplause They're out there -- actually  he had them here in the East Room at one point.
nonapplause Now  interestingly enough  a number of people in the Republican majority are saying  okay  well  I'll go along with the drug program as long as everybody doesn't get it.
nonapplause That work will have to be done by the people who will be here after the 2000 election.
nonapplause You know  poor Jack; he has a terrible time with Lyndon.
nonapplause What are our common responsibilities?
nonapplause America deserves it and so do you.
nonapplause They overlook a fundamental fact: We were not in Iraq on September 11th  2001  and the terrorists hit us anyway.
nonapplause There need be no characterization that is negative when this process is over.
nonapplause General Secretary  I don't like the way President Reagan's running his country.'"
nonapplause So we passed some empowerment zone legislation to see whether or not with extreme incentives we could revitalize some of the really distressed areas of the country.
nonapplause That's why Secretary Bell and I have been pushing hard for a national agenda for excellence in education.
nonapplause And Americans can always count on the Marines.
nonapplause A new and lively sense of purpose—yes.
nonapplause We're going to make it all new again and see if we can't create a system of incentives which reenforce work and family and independence.
nonapplause President Reagan's recent Summit meeting in Moscow with Mr. Gorbachev was an historic success.

nonapplause It is my purpose on behalf of the United States to commemorate this magnificent museum  meeting as we do among memorials within the site of the memorial to Thomas Jefferson  the author of our freedom.
nonapplause You know what we're forgetting?
nonapplause The Common Agricultural Policy was swallowing up ever more resources—not to pay over to the farmers  but to finance food mountains and wine lakes.
nonapplause Well  part of it is we had a big drop in the stock market  a big crisis in the economy occasioned by September the 11th  and the need to spend more money on national defense as a result.
nonapplause But -- that's okay  I didn't have any gray hair when I went there.
nonapplause Franklin Roosevelt knew who had been omitted and ignored  and he knew who had omitted and ignored them  and he set about to help the forgotten man  to light the farms  to help the aged  to protect the worker  to open new doors to the Negroes  to care for the needs of millions of Americans in thousands of different ways.
nonapplause When John Kerry suggests a global test  he goes right back to his beginnings in politics  when he ran for Congress the first time and said we should only deploy U.S. troops under the authority of the United Nations.
nonapplause I went down as a member of Congress  and an observer of those elections.
nonapplause This outline has become well known to the international community and to both peoples -- the Palestinian and Israeli people.
nonapplause It gives us inspiration.
nonapplause Let's us work together.
nonapplause All the funds that I have were given to me by generous individuals.
nonapplause We wouldn't be here having this conversation -- this election wouldn't even be about all this stuff.
nonapplause These are tragedies.
nonapplause I made it 20 years and not more than that  because any more than that I wasn't a Republican.

nonapplause And I'm very proud of his service and excited about his promotion.

nonapplause That's what they said.
nonapplause Respect yourself.
nonapplause This is the greatest country in human history.
nonapplause We've developed a new rapport with Mexico  a rapport that's based on mutual respect  that is better than at any time in the history of our two proud nations.
nonapplause A panel of state judges in Texas said he was one of the three best lawyers in his part of the state.

nonapplause On the local level  school districts and communities in all 50 States have raised their academic standards.
nonapplause But all our people must be assured that their rights and dignity will be respected as new drugs  treatments and therapies are tested and used.
nonapplause We didn't really operate as a nation as though we were at war  even though the al Qaeda had declared war on us.
nonapplause You see  and the question is -- and this is the fundamental question facing Washington  D.C. -- once we meet fundamental obligations and pay down debt  once we increase discretionary spending by 4 percent  what do we do with the money left over?
nonapplause And that's why the G20 will take the lead in building a new approach to cooperation.
nonapplause She was nervous when she got up here to speak.
nonapplause Obviously  when we're in the black we're still collecting benefits.
nonapplause If I told you the dollar loss  it wouldn't seem like much to you  but they lost two-thirds of their annual GDP.
nonapplause Perhaps this is why your institutions are so important for us to preserve.
nonapplause It was a tangled maze of poorly maintained back roads that were rarely the fastest or the most efficient way to get from point A to point B. Fortunately  President Eisenhower made an investment that revolutionized the way we travel -- an investment that made our lives easier and our economy grow.
nonapplause We've stopped that social promotion and students now in Virginia are earning self-esteem  which is so important for their future.
nonapplause And I've endorsed the idea of consolidating congressional investigations  so that Congress can pursue its work even more effectively.
nonapplause And that is changing everything else in ways that are  more often than not  quite positive  but sometimes quite troubling.
nonapplause Europe's instability of the early 20th century stemmed  in part  from its non-democratic character  the Kaiser of Germany  the Czar of Russia  the Hapsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire.
nonapplause Or is it necessary for them to follow the example of the Communists  the Chinese  and the Russians?

nonapplause We're a good country  a generous  compassionate  idealistic country.

nonapplause The attacks continued: the first bombing at the World Trade Center in 1993; the murders at the Saudi Arabia National Guard training facility in 1995; the attack on Khobar Towers in 1996; the simultaneous bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; and the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.
nonapplause Fortunately  the American people sensed this dangerous drift  and by 1980  a national reawakening was underway -- a reawakening that resulted in a new sense of responsibility  a new sense of confidence in America and the universal principles and ideals on which our free system is based.
nonapplause The recession has certainly made it worse  but that feeling of not being in control of your own economic future -- that sense that the American Dream might slowly be slipping away -- that's been around for some time now.
nonapplause We know that our children deserve better all across America.
nonapplause So long as both the United States and the Soviet Union prove their good faith by destroying nuclear missiles year by year  we would not deploy SDI.
nonapplause I was just home for the weekend  and I know what a lot of folks at home think.
nonapplause We are working to stop weapons from spreading at the source  as with Russia.
nonapplause Well  as I look at you and meet young people like you all over the country  I know we still have a secret weapon  and it's the best blankety-blank kids in the world.
nonapplause As Henry VIII said to each one of his six wives --   -- “I won't keep you long.”   Fellow conservatives and dear friends  it's such a pleasure to be with you again.
nonapplause And it would be a good faith gesture on people from both political parties to say  we see we've got a problem on mandatory spending  why don't we start reforming the system for the sake of future generations of Americans.
nonapplause The fourth great task for the next government will be to restore the rule of law.
nonapplause But I can tell you  as the father of two young girls  I don't want a plan that interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor.
nonapplause And this is something I'm very serious about.
nonapplause Mr. President  these men and women have been incredibly cooperative with us in the Recovery Act.
nonapplause And that's my only official duty and responsibility.
nonapplause What is the most fundamental long-term problem in America?
nonapplause And we came to a waterfall  and we all got out to look.

nonapplause No one can tell you how to live or what cause to serve.
nonapplause ﻿  Vice President's Remarks at John Swallow Luncheon
nonapplause And they were the ones on the offensive.
nonapplause And that's why it was so important that we were able to bring cultural and public diplomacy programs into the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy  when we brought USIA and all the various programs that it involved within the State Department  itself  and why we have to continue working together on a bipartisan basis to finance them more generously.
nonapplause Truly  President Bush has stolen the symbolism and body language of religion and used it to disguise the most radical effort in American history to take what rightfully belongs to the American people  and give as much of it as possible to the already wealthy and privileged.
nonapplause And gradually we are learning the details of his hidden weapons program.
nonapplause So I think this is very  very important.
nonapplause All of these issues are rooted in the fact that no one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own  nor effectively advance its interests in isolation.

nonapplause Thank you very much  and buenas tardes.
nonapplause You know  I never called it that.
nonapplause And this happens over and over and over again.
nonapplause In spite of all the problems in the world  infant mortality was down and life expectancy was up.
nonapplause And we should applaud all those in both parties who were part of that.
nonapplause But we are poised to begin the reconstruction of our country in earnest  and the first steps have already been taken.
nonapplause Reading recently  I came across the starkly simple phrase:
nonapplause It's also an honor to be here on the Mississippi River.
nonapplause Well  first  I'm going to sign an executive order directing all federal agencies to purchase appliances that meet the one-watt standard  wherever cost-effective.
nonapplause It's in the interests of the United States to encourage other nations not to relent and not to give in  but to keep the pressure on those who try to have their way by murdering the innocent.
nonapplause And if they think just a little bit more  they will realize that the issue that faces us is not whether we are going to legislate morality  but whether the morality which we legislate is going to be true or false.
nonapplause So we have been complicit in these problems.
nonapplause Later  he would reflect on that time  on both the heartbreak and the fulfillment he found during those years.
nonapplause And with labor and management pulling together with renewed confidence and spirit  our competitors are about to learn that once Americans put our minds to it  once we're provided the proper tools and equipment  we can outproduce  outcompete  and outsell anybody  anytime  anywhere in the world.
nonapplause You know  there's an old expression  "Those also serve who stand and wait."
nonapplause I think it's a little providence  as well as a little luck.
nonapplause I recall when I was growing up how difficult it was for my mother and father to raise five boys on the income from  first a little citrus ranch  and later a country store  put us through school  get enough at the end of the month to take care of our shoes and our clothing  have a little left over for life insurance  not very much  and also I remember how difficult it was when we had much illness in my younger years and how difficult it was to pay those bills.
nonapplause My father did not live to see how his dream for the U.N. dissolved in the face of the harsh realities of the Cold War and the inadequacies of the U.N. system itself.
nonapplause And where it has dropped  almost without exception  it has dropped because people have found something positive for children to do in the hours between the time school ends and the time their parents come home at night.
nonapplause I also want to commend the center's manager  Margarita Lobo  who I got to meet earlier  and thank her and everyone  all the staff and patients and physicians who I got to meet and who are working here at Unity Health Care and the Upper Cardozo Center  for such an incredible warm welcome and such an informative session right before I came in.
nonapplause They were civic institutions that have helped save our nation and our world in the half-century since.
nonapplause Why make teenagers the focus of a fully day's discussion at the White House.
nonapplause Somebody over here  number two.
nonapplause I want America to be that nation.
nonapplause For five and a half years now  I have had the great honor of serving you and working with others to strengthen America for a new century  a global information age.
nonapplause I feel that way about our country.
nonapplause But we knew then that inflation  the quiet thief  and record interest rates were stealing our future.
nonapplause In the absence of sensible policies that invest in long-term public goods like education or basic research  roads  railways  broadband  a smart electric grid -- an absence of those investments can be equally disastrous.
nonapplause Our troops make clear that America is committed to remaining a Pacific power  and everyday they help the Pacific region live up to its name.
nonapplause We are trying to get every country to come up with a plan for their reconstruction  which breaks down by category and place everything they're going to do in housing  education  health care  livelihoods  disaster mitigation -- all the things they're going to do  and then  by category  what the cost is  so that we can fill in the blanks.
nonapplause I want to thank Barbara Turner and Judith Lee and Kate Casey for reminding us why we're all here.
nonapplause It is not created by Governments.
nonapplause When I became President  I had been a governor for 12 years in a state that had a lot of the same problems that the South Bronx had.
nonapplause Those who kill the innocent lives or those who have no concept of liberty  have no sense of justice  have no respect for human rights and human dignity.
nonapplause No Secretary of State could ever have had stronger support than I've had from the President and the Vice President  or from my colleagues in the National Security Council  many of whom I'm proud and pleased are here today.
nonapplause Less than a minute later  there was an explosion  and the entire inside of the car was engulfed in flames.
nonapplause Not so long ago  some had their doubts about the American character  our capacity to meet serious challenges or to serve a cause greater than self-interest.
nonapplause I think continuing to pay down the debt is very important.
nonapplause That's why all these cameras are here.
nonapplause And freedom is on the march.

nonapplause But during this debate  I want you all to remember that there is a huge consumer debt burdening many people working for a living in America  that there are 61 million Americans  I've been told  that have $10 000 or more of consumer debt.
nonapplause Iraq  obviously there  we had to go use force as well  too.
nonapplause Because two dedicated public employees brought this successful innovation to his attention  today it is becoming the law of the land everywhere  thanks to the Congress.

nonapplause And there were a number of things in the bill that they passed.

nonapplause Now  there's no easy formula for fixing our health care system.
nonapplause You and I have come to office in a time of crisis for our country  but we're working our way out of an inherited economic mess that is the worst this country has seen in the last 40 years.
nonapplause But I didn't finish.
nonapplause That's the ultimate threat we're faced with today.
nonapplause We will do fine  because most people run the rest of their lives the way we believe our country ought to be run.
nonapplause That's a $5 billion cut in tariffs on the American products exported to other nations.
nonapplause Mr. Speaker  you can never do that except by first restoring the spirit of the people.
nonapplause I thank Secretary Slater for coming.
nonapplause Even with an unbelievably bad voice  he is better than anyone else who could stand up here  so it is difficult.

nonapplause All sides should have one goal before them  and let us state it simply and directly: to end the violence  to end it completely  and to end it now.
nonapplause When folks were saying our sights were set too high; that our faith in this country was misplaced; that our hope was naïve; that you couldn't change Washington; that you had to accommodate yourself to the political realities.
nonapplause And he proceeded to say that he and the other justices would now meet to determine what would happen to this chief justice.
nonapplause But what Ken said is really worth remembering.
nonapplause On education  I said I'm all for spending more money on education  but we also have to lift the standards of excellence and accountability.
nonapplause The greatest thing that's happened in some ways to all of our cities is the capacity that you have developed to dramatically lower crime rates.

nonapplause But there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.
nonapplause Federal Emergency Management Administrator James Lee Witt has transformed that agency into a model for disaster assistance and helped communities all across our country to rebuild.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause That's good for all of us  because when prosperity is created in India  that's a new market for our goods; when new ideas take hold in China  that pushes our businesses to innovate; when new connections are forged among people  all of us are enriched.
nonapplause The growth that our expansion has brought America can be just the beginning.
nonapplause This morning we first thank God for the shared blessings of American liberty.
nonapplause That's what I think will happen with China coming into the World Trade Organization.
nonapplause This party  I believe .

nonapplause So thank you all for coming and  Congressman  the floor is yours.
nonapplause Finally  let me mention in regard to the budget that in addition to the support for education from Head Start through high school graduation  this budget takes another huge step toward opening the doors of college education to all Americans.
nonapplause Now  here are the things we want to do.
nonapplause We have to begin with the basics.
nonapplause It hasn't been quite that way in 1960.
nonapplause What struck me  and what I think struck us all  was the point made by both Nicaraguan Minister Margarita Guardian and Iranian cardiologist Dr. Nizal Sarraf-Zadegan  that these challenges are all interconnected.
nonapplause And then there was a huge story on the cover of -- I think it was USA Today not very long ago -- saying that the people didn't know if there was any difference between the two candidates on their economic policy -- the two candidates for President.
nonapplause That is what this day is all about.
nonapplause A lot of times in Washington  as you know  we tend to talk; and sometimes  the talk isn't backed up by action.
nonapplause Above $29 000 and up to $70 000  you keep 75 cents out of each dollar.
nonapplause Many doubted it could ever be achieved  yet in a short time  President Bush transformed the education debate in Washington.
nonapplause Yet the psychological benefit and the lives that would be changed would be enormous.
nonapplause Now  already we're beginning to see some of these investments pay off.
nonapplause Now  we've been working on that.
nonapplause This was about giving new life to our party.
nonapplause And finally  to have more responsibility in the system.
nonapplause I can look at 20 years of voting in the United States Senate  and I see a senator who has consistently voted in a way that I think doesn't reflect the views  and the philosophy  and the attitude of the man who would pursue the kind of strategy that I think is essential if we're going to prevail in the war on terror.
nonapplause That was such a...
nonapplause And finally he couldn't stand it anymore  and he said  "Reverend  I wish you could have seen this when the Lord was doing it by himself."
nonapplause So go ahead and give that to them.

nonapplause He stood one cold January day before the members of your statehouse  and he said  "I carry with me from this State to that high and lonely office to which I now succeed more than fond memories and friendships.
nonapplause meaning that many people would not live long enough to become eligible for retirement benefits.
nonapplause But far from objecting then  they said this was good for us.
nonapplause He wants to know how you think and how you feel.
nonapplause One of those big challenges is what to do about the aging of America  which is a high-class problem.
nonapplause Let's put that one on Jeopardy.
nonapplause All of you are helping to redefine the role of universities in our communities  replacing the old image of the remote ivory tower with a caring and engaged partner.
nonapplause But all the surveys show that what people really resent is they think we don't know enough  care enough or do enough about people who aren't right in front of us.
nonapplause It is not a world without change but a world in which change is our friend and not our enemy.
nonapplause Iraqi children are in school  security forces are being trained  the economy is coming back  and the country is on a course toward free elections.
nonapplause It's good for our economy  it's good for our people.

nonapplause And that Joycelyn Elders was Surgeon General    and that she was suggesting that kids should be doing in the back seat things that a lot of people didn't think kids should be doing in the front seat  the back seat  at home or at work or at play  or in any way whatsoever.
nonapplause Of course  the most recent example and most visible example of this partnership between citizens and police happened two weeks ago in Times Square.
nonapplause They live on the edge of an area dominated by the narco-traffickers.
nonapplause During his 11 years in Congress  Charlie Bass has improved the business climate for New Hampshire entrepreneurs  so they can expand their companies and create more jobs for the 2nd district.
nonapplause A very simple program.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause Equally  if you look at the rise of public spiritedness in this country as we got the great increase in industrial power in the last century  alongside that came a great burgeoning in public spiritedness.
nonapplause I think it's very  very important.
nonapplause And American consumers receive more goods at lower prices  products like sorbet from South Africa  and woodcarvings from Tanzania  and tuna from right here in Senegal.
nonapplause For those of you who are old enough to remember that  or young enough to have studied it  you may know also that  in addition to the courage of the young children and the power of the Supreme Court's decisions and the court orders  the power of the Presidency was necessary for the integration of Little Rock Central High School when President Eisenhower sent in the 101st Airborne Division and later federalized the Arkansas National Guard to stop the obstruction.
nonapplause You won't always get credit for what you do.
nonapplause I am grateful to all of you.
nonapplause But that is the price we have had to pay for getting the reductions in spending.
nonapplause I want to tell you that of all the speeches I've made  hundreds of them  thousands of them  I still get a knot in my stomach or the speech isn't any good.
nonapplause So we've have to deal with that set of domestic circumstances at the same time that we've been forced to respond from a national security standpoint to the military requirements.
nonapplause It's a novel way of saying to young workers  we understand whose money we're spending; and two  we want you to be able to have more security in your retirement -- and that is to allow younger workers to take some of their own payroll taxes and set aside -- set it aside in what's called a personal retirement account  a personal retirement account that will earn a better rate of return than the current Social Security trust earns; a personal retirement account which you will call your own; a personal retirement account that can be only invested in conservative stocks and bonds; a conservative account that you can't withdraw all your money upon retirement.
nonapplause Now  let me turn to the other issue that I know is uppermost in the minds of everybody here - that's the future of America  but not only our future but the future of free people throughout the world.
nonapplause We say  let's put more police on the street in the high-crime neighborhoods; let's close the gun show loophole in the background check law  which you voted to do in Florida  overwhelmingly; have mandatory child safety locks; and stop importing these large-capacity ammunition clips which allow the manufacturers to get around the assault weapons ban.
nonapplause Michelle and I and our daughters enjoyed it very much.
nonapplause Medigap coverage  for example  gets more expensive for people as they get older and have less money to spend on it.
nonapplause Their solution is to tell people don't worry  things will fix themselves.
nonapplause This vision contemplates an America in which every American -- consumers  small business people  corporate CEOs -- will be able to extend our trade to the farthest reaches of the planet.
nonapplause And if you take the total unfunded liability  that is money -- benefits we've committed to  if we leave the program as is  but that we're just not going to pay for it  or haven't figured out how to pay for it yet over the total life of the system is over $11 trillion.
nonapplause I happen to believe also that the policies and the programs which my colleague  Henry Cabot Lodge and I advocate  that those policies and programs can best accomplish that objective and I would like to say in that connection that while time will not permit me to do more than sum them up  that I believe that to keep the peace we must design programs which will take into account the nature of those who threaten the peace  the men in the Kremlin.
nonapplause They gave us murderous double-digit inflation  sky-high interest rates  unemployment  economic stagnation  and national insecurity.
nonapplause This administration has got a strong agenda to keep this nation secure and prosperous.
nonapplause Which has tackled many of the fundamental economic problems from its industrial problems  its trade union problems  its enterprise problems and  in fact  the reputation of our country rides high in the eyes of the world.
nonapplause We embrace the virtues of inclusion in our party and in politics but we hold firm to our core national values.
nonapplause We've made a wonderful home in D.C.

nonapplause I'm thrilled by this enormous crowd  honored by your enthusiasm and support  your concern and your commitment for your country.
nonapplause You know  I probably couldn't do this much traveling when Congress was in session  as Ken will tell you.
nonapplause But there are a couple of points I'd like to make this morning  and I'll try to be fairly brief so I don't use up all the time  and we save some time for you to have an opportunity to ask questions and make comments  as well  too.
nonapplause I work the ropelines a lot  and people say  "Mr. President  I pray for you and your family."
nonapplause Why is this important?
nonapplause For that purpose  we've brought together an impressive group of entrepreneurs  industry leaders  economists and other leading thinkers to conduct a dialogue on securing our economic future.
nonapplause And I won't bore you with the details -- you may have better ideas than I do.
nonapplause This particular project  for reasons which are not entirely clear  did not enjoy the wholehearted support of the British Government.
nonapplause So we don't do enough.
nonapplause America is on the move again and expanding toward new eras of opportunity for everyone.
nonapplause On the other hand  millions of Americans join us in boldly charting a new course for the future.
nonapplause There hasn't been a transition like this since Inauguration Day in 1837  when Andrew Jackson turned the keys to the store over to Martin Van Buren.
nonapplause Student loans that are guaranteed by the government have been made less expensive and easier to repay.
nonapplause Like Jared  they remind us all that the price of freedom is great.
nonapplause And as I say  I can't think of a brighter group of people to ask for help in shaping that history.
nonapplause Now  I think it's two-fold.
nonapplause That's an imperative "get away from it!"
nonapplause Now  if you want your children to live in a country that may have even less than four percent of the world's population and still around 20 percent of the world's wealth because of how hard we work and our skills and our ability  there are only two things we can do.
nonapplause But we know that America's interest and America's heart were close to this King and this country.
nonapplause Well   It will give us the courage to face the uncertainties of the future.
nonapplause There wasn't any way then we could have anticipated what was about to happen  of course  on 9/11.
nonapplause There are a lot of first-generation immigration children in that school  it was basically a poor school.
nonapplause That means we have to rethink what we collect and how we organize the intelligence community to collect it.
nonapplause And after the Mondale mortgage  we'd be sure to have more than a few foreclosures.
nonapplause Thanks so much  Jenna.
nonapplause Strong  continuous  low-inflationary growth has meant that not only are more Americans working than ever before but their paychecks are growing  too.
nonapplause We will use up our inventory  use up our backlog  and 6 months from now we can go back to work and our profits will still be up."
nonapplause They've faced extraordinary challenges  and they have performed brilliantly in every mission that's been given to them.
nonapplause And he went on like that.
nonapplause But as I have often said a record is not something to stand on but something to build on.
nonapplause Education has benefited people in both poor and rich countries more than ever before  but 130 million children never go to school at all.
nonapplause They came to the problem because it was there.
nonapplause And the voters in Virginia can only vote on what they know  just like voters everywhere.
nonapplause You know  Robert Byrd did use the phrase  “When I die  West Virginia will be written on my heart.” And I used to kid him  I said  “You have so many Scotch-Irish down there  you don't acknowledge it was an Irish Catholic named Joyce who said that first.”   Reverend  he quoted everybody else  but when he used that phrase  he'd never acknowledge that it was James Joyce who said  “When I die  Dublin will be written in my heart.” And all he would do is laugh.
nonapplause A neutral observer  looking at these examples from Senator Kerry's record  would assume that the Senator actually supported military action against Saddam Hussein.
nonapplause So I say to you  look for the unifying vision and continue to work for it.
nonapplause And yet so often  we direct our prayers to those problems that are immediate to us  knowing that He has promised His help to us when we turn to Him.

nonapplause In consultation with Secretary of State Clinton  as well as OPM Director John Berry  my administration has completed a long and thorough review to identify a number of areas where we can extend federal benefits to the same-sex partners of Foreign Service and executive branch government employees.
nonapplause We know that the promise of places like DeSoto and projects like the creation of a modern electricity grid mean a continuation of that long march of progress in this country.
nonapplause But when I think about the presidency  and I've worked for four Presidents now  and I've watched two others up close  from the perspective of the Congress.
nonapplause We need people who see the immense promise that's everywhere in our country  and I know that Heather is that kind of person.
nonapplause Now  I know the Vice President has more to say about BusinessLINC  so I'd like to ask him to say a few things and then we'll just start calling on the people around the table.
nonapplause And yet at this moment  a moment that will define a generation  it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
nonapplause Government is not supposed to wage war against God and religion  not in the United States of America.
nonapplause Our founders would also be pleased to walk these streets again and to find  amid the problems of modern life  a familiar American spirit of faith and good works.
nonapplause These are the ideals at the core of your mission -- a mission that dates back before our founding -- one taken up by our first President years before he took office  back when he served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.
nonapplause Today I was able to welcome them all to the White House to the Oval Office and now on the South Lawn.

nonapplause But Carter-Mondale watched helpless as 180 000 Ohio jobs disappeared in the period between 1976 and 1980."
nonapplause But indeed  we were and it was because of the steadfastness and the commitment of America  of our men and women in uniform  of our leaders  and indeed of the American people to a cause greater than ourselves.
nonapplause After funding priorities  after paying down debt  after setting up a contingency fund we still have money left over.
nonapplause The United States consul  who had seen his comedy show  granted him a visa on one condition: he had to promise to continue his career in America.

nonapplause Other nations have recognised that for years now.
nonapplause Exports alone support more than 12 million American jobs  and these tend  on average  to be high-paying positions.
nonapplause As a congressman during the decisive years of the Cold War  I saw the conviction and the moral courage of Ronald Reagan.
nonapplause Then the economy turned a little south on us and I began to say  not only can we afford it  we cannot afford not to have it.
nonapplause But Mr. Truman could make very plain the differences between himself and his opponent.
nonapplause Those are five.

nonapplause We made the Republican Party into the party of working people; the family; the neighborhood; the defense of freedom; and  yes  "one nation under God."
nonapplause We don't have plural executives  in America  anywhere.
nonapplause And so folks  what we're all about today -- not only in building this -- priming the pump to be able to build this fire house -- and that's what it is  it's priming the pump  you all are doing a lot locally -- not only in this housing money and all the things -- some of the things I mentioned.
nonapplause It will take all of us working together to meet the serious challenges that America faces.
nonapplause We shouldn't bring them into our political life."
nonapplause Vigorous  growing economies generate the technologies and the means to fight hunger and disease  and to provide better stewardship of the land and the life around us.

nonapplause Look  this is a big industry.
nonapplause And my answer was  "I do not know."
nonapplause But I do say we can move off dead center.
nonapplause Our program  aimed at private sector growth rather than more government and higher taxes  stood in stark contrast to failed liberal policies of the past two decades.
nonapplause You know  earlier today I went to Kearney  to speak at the University of Nebraska there  to the young people about an American foreign policy for the 21st century.
nonapplause You've been hearing about the fact that American prestige  Mr. Stevenson says  is at an alltime low.

nonapplause They face challenges in their lives just like you do.
nonapplause They have forgotten that here is the bulwark of American security  the bulwark of American stability  and carrying on as we do in a great tradition  I think that this would be an opportunity early in the administration of the Democratic President  to go and stretch his hand out once again to the south of us  to build strong those chains and then look to the rest of the world for action to protect our mutual security.

nonapplause Coach Williams had to remind him that there were a bunch of guys with guns around.

nonapplause We stand for an idea whose time is now: Only by lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and can peace among all nations be secure.
nonapplause Now  as we stabilized the financial system  we also took steps to get our economy growing again  save as many jobs as possible  and help Americans who had become unemployed.
nonapplause Peace will not move forward unless effort is extended and ideas are put forth.
nonapplause The legislation passed overwhelmingly  with a vote in the Senate of 87 to 12  and that small group of 12 senators voting no included Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards.
nonapplause Thank you very much  Bill  for that wonderful introduction.
nonapplause So  let me just say  on behalf of the American people  thank you for all you're doing for our country.
nonapplause And when you hear your Republican friends back in your neighborhood saying that the Democrats are the party of big government  ask them  well  if that's so  why is the government now the smallest it's been since 1965?
nonapplause Another obstacle is export controls on technology.
nonapplause I think we can do more  and having known  we can do more  I think we should not do less.
nonapplause Today we act to ensure that international trade on the Internet remains free of new discriminatory taxes  free of tariffs  free from burdens and regulations  and safe from piracy.
nonapplause And she said  that's a lot.
nonapplause Democracies virtues are at the core of why we have worked so hard to support the reforms and the reformers in Russia  which is now on a path toward becoming one of the Pacific's great democratic powers.
nonapplause And most of your jokes are not repeatable  and you can't do this anymore.
nonapplause Judge Sotomayor is a distinguished graduate of two of America's leading universities.
nonapplause It's worth noting that people from 80 nations died at the World Trade Center.
nonapplause And when people become more open to new ideas and new information it means that there are also more opportunities for the organized forces of destruction to take advantage of that openness.
nonapplause We see it in the increasing recognition among progressives that government can't solve all of our problems  and that talking about values like responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage are integral to any anti-poverty agenda.
nonapplause As teachers  as parents  and as citizens  all of us have the responsibility to ensure that every child has access to education  an education that will lead to a happy and healthy life.
nonapplause I know what side he's on  and he's on the right side with regard to taxes and what we're trying to do.
nonapplause I say that not because I think the situations are analogous  but because everybody needs a dream  and I think whether you all decide to sign this or not depends in part on what your dream is.
nonapplause We've substantially increased funding to improve water quality in the Great Lakes.
nonapplause Now to compare that to the rate of return that you  in effect  get on your Social Security when you pay into the regular Social Security trust fund  that's less than 2 percent.
nonapplause The protestors against the global economy always forget to say that this globalizing economy has lifted more people out of poverty in the last 20 years than ever before in human history.
nonapplause The alliance that helped to keep the peace for half century now brings us closer than ever to that dream of a Europe united  democratic and at peace.
nonapplause So this morning  among the nation's most influential urban leaders  I want to speak about the essential choices facing our Congress and our country when it comes to the reform of our public schools.
nonapplause In 1983  we said we've got a problem in our schools  we need to take tougher courses  we need to have other reforms.
nonapplause But he does  if we continue to define the issues as more government and less government  and more spending and less spending--like the only thing that matters in this country is money.
nonapplause That's my promise to every one of you  every man and woman who wears America's uniform.
nonapplause One of the reasons why Barack and I set off on this journey was to sort of re-instill that confidence in a new generation of parents who played by the rules  but it didn't quite work out for them.
nonapplause Ask them to give it another try.
nonapplause I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city.
nonapplause Because such men and women have always been willing to serve  our nation has been able to win freedom for others  to hold off the ambitions of the violent  and to keep the peace in troubled places.
nonapplause Since the beginning of the environmental movement  we've been trying to transform the way we use energy and reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels to tap into the vast  untapped  renewable energy sources and to use energy more efficiently.
nonapplause Well  "neonate" is the word that this gentleman will introduce into our vocabulary--you will  sadly  probably hear more of it--in order to dehumanize infant life.
nonapplause So I'd like to talk a little bit about what my administration plans to achieve in the next hundred days.
nonapplause When a machine takes the job of 5 men or 10 men  where are those men going to get jobs.
nonapplause You don't ask whether this is a pre-existing condition you're looking at.
nonapplause One year ago -- one year ago -- they warned that interest rates would soar back above 20 percent  breaking all the old records.
nonapplause Can you imagine how bad I would look if I had actually jumped out of an airplane?
nonapplause Much further away from you in Greensboro  North Carolina  another small company called Createc Forestry Systems is showing how our trade helps people turn their hopes into realities.
nonapplause And I also want to thank all the workers at Duro-Last and Plastatech for your hospitality today  we really appreciate your letting us come by to spend a little bit of time with you.
nonapplause The fate of the Iraqi regime is being determined by its own decisions.
nonapplause That's how we achieved so much at the end of the past Congress.
nonapplause But time and again  it's only made possible by generations that are willing to work and sacrifice and invest in plans to make tomorrow better than today.
nonapplause This is a wonderful  lively group -- I heard you all giggling earlier today.
nonapplause I hope that from now until election day you will put out a maximum effort to make him Mississippi's first Republican Governor in more than a hundred years.
nonapplause So our second great challenge is homeland security.
nonapplause You don't know if it's a insurance company that wants to see some of the provisions in health reform repealed because it's good for their bottom line  even if it's not good for the American people.
nonapplause And you did it because you wanted your country to grow together.
nonapplause Don's taken and signed the taxpayer protection pledge; the voters deserve to know where his opponent stands.
nonapplause And we will do all we can to help.
nonapplause We'll always need gifted  motivated case officers at the heart of the clandestine service.
nonapplause Now what does that have to do with what we do in Washington?
nonapplause This we cannot do -?
nonapplause It was the Taliban and their support for al-Qaida that allowed al-Qaida to flourish  to become the organization that it did  to plot and to plan and then to launch the attacks of September 11th.
nonapplause Each was once or still is the most important person in someone's life.
nonapplause And allow me to also acknowledge Governor Wilson's Chief of Staff  George Dunn  and all other members of the administration and members of the leadership  including committee chairs and ranking members.
nonapplause I should say half of Connecticut because there were people.
nonapplause It's very nice to come hear kind words from a colleague like John  but I want to thank him today in front of all of his constituents for the great work he does every day for his district  for the state of Oklahoma  and for the nation.
nonapplause Do you know why a candidate for the Presidency of Brazil took a trip to see Castro?
nonapplause What was Senator Kerry's record on the committee as the terrorist threat gathered around the world?
nonapplause God bless you.
nonapplause And let me also begin by thanking my assistant and partner in crime in this  John Wyman  who enabled me with him to claim to be the tallest team in this entire conference.
nonapplause Now  they are afraid  the drug companies are  if all the seniors in the country can get their drugs through Medicare  that Medicare as a big buyer will acquire so much power in the market  we could buy drugs for our seniors made in America almost as cheaply as seniors in Canada can buy drugs made in America.
nonapplause Terrorists were able to -- and terrorist networks were able to operate in and out of his country.
nonapplause It is absolutely necessary that we restore that capacity to defend ourselves.
nonapplause Now  no President can do all that alone.
nonapplause And this to a great extent is to be realized through the unity and organization that many of you here have dedicated your life to promoting within the Latino community.
nonapplause This debate is over how to balance the budget  not whether to balance the budget.
nonapplause We've been through a great many political battles together.
nonapplause We are moving the country in the right direction  toward a world that works better for all the people.
nonapplause It was passed to try to help save the lives of law enforcement officials who have to go out on the streets and sometimes face gangs that are better armed than they are.
nonapplause Well  in our country today there are two teams -- the Washington Tax Increase Team and the American Opportunity Team.
nonapplause Assemblywoman Buono  State Senator Bryant  Hudson County Executive Bob Janiszewski  Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin  Sheriff Fontura  Mayor-About-To-Be Bob Bowser  Mayor Spina  and all other officials who are here.
nonapplause We've seen this before.
nonapplause And let's talk for a moment about foreign policy.
nonapplause And I know that many of you have already developed demonstration programs  and we hope that more of you will do so.
nonapplause Never has the opportunity been more real and it must not be lost.
nonapplause I mean  look around here.
nonapplause If the dream of America is to be preserved  we must not waste the genius of one mind  the strength of one body  or the spirit of one soul.
nonapplause Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?
nonapplause More and more it is a health care issue.
nonapplause I can remember when the campaign in Afghanistan was just beginning.
nonapplause The governors understand that.
nonapplause America's economy is strong and  yes  I do believe the American people are better off than they were before.
nonapplause And if you don't believe that the big spenders will go back to their old ways  then you believe that J. R. Ewing when he promises that he'll never be unfaithful again.
nonapplause Will you make sure to turn out for the Republican ticket on November 8th?
nonapplause Part of it has to do with the fact that women are more likely than men to do part-time work or to work in a small business -- in jobs that are less likely to offer the kind of insurance that you really need.
nonapplause That meant that at the moment that Jeb Bush declared himself to be thus incompetent -- and I use the word advisedly -- in the face of the judicial order  the executive power in Florida was transferred from him to the probate judge  who became the supreme executive authority in the state of Florida.
nonapplause Hillary and I are delighted to see you all here.
nonapplause We had the great introduction of the Welfare State.
nonapplause That's what California  like America  has been for so many millions through the years.
nonapplause There are wars over land and wars over resources.
nonapplause Thank you all  and God bless you all.
nonapplause Second  we'll strive to act preventively  not preemptively  to avoid whenever possible  or wherever possible the choice of last resort between the risks of war and the dangers of inaction.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy  Jefferson-Jackson Day Brunch
nonapplause September 11th  2001 made clear the challenges we face.
nonapplause The 9/11 attack was the worst ever on American soil.
nonapplause He said  'You know we saw two different kinds of people on September 11th.
nonapplause The problem he presents to the world is that he has laboratories working to produce chemical and biological weapons.
nonapplause So it's vital that people remember that.
nonapplause That's a very good start.
nonapplause In 2006  I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush administration and passed by the Congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework  with the kind of meaningful due process rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal.
nonapplause But already  liberals in the House have proposed a budget that would undermine the improving economy with a frontal assault on the policies that have gotten America on the mend.
nonapplause My directive borrows heavily and gratefully from their wise and thoughtful statement.
nonapplause We've got challenges in setting new goals and high standards in agencies that sometimes aren't anxious to change.
nonapplause But I'm doing it for other reasons.
nonapplause And especially in a period of war and recession-induced deficits  we need to show extra care in our spending priorities and the discipline that fits the times.
nonapplause And she said  well  because if it wasn't there would be a lot of people like me home watching the soaps because we don't believe we can make anything of ourselves anymore.
nonapplause When people say they worry about whether we've still got it as a country  I say to them  why do you think the Israelis and the Arabs want to come here and have us work with them to end the decades of horrible fighting in the Middle East?
nonapplause Overall  it is a record of which we can both be proud and a tribute to the very real and deep friendship felt towards Kenya in Britain.
nonapplause And may God bless you and may God continue to bless America.
nonapplause So I want to persuade you to spend time in the classroom  talking and showing young people what it is that your work can mean  and what it means to you.
nonapplause This was my second serious visit to the hospital since getting to Washington  and I'm not a bit discouraged or anything about it.
nonapplause It was costing more than $10 billion in financial losses  touching 30 percent of America's homes  and taking the lives of more than 23 000 Americans a year.
nonapplause And  most important to us in this coming year  he sits on that very key House Appropriations Committee for us.
nonapplause We had a woman who spends her life working in a medical office  calling trying to get authorization for procedures.
nonapplause I didn't mentioned her.
nonapplause Where ideas are suppressed  we provide space for open debate.
nonapplause We listened to the voices of those in my party and in the Democratic Party who wanted additional help for those at the lowest end of the economic ladder.
nonapplause The budget keeps us on track toward paying down the debt  so that in 15 years our nation will be debt-free  for the first time since 1835.
nonapplause “No  we can't.”
nonapplause And good luck to all the other chase drivers joining us today.
nonapplause Increasingly  we are moving from the economy of the Industrial Revolution  an economy tied to the Earth's natural resources  to an economy based on information  where that old cliche  "Knowledge is Power " is truer than ever.
nonapplause He was a Member of the British Parliament  and he changed parties and was criticized for doing so.
nonapplause The Parthenon was the brain child of the great statesman  Pericles.
nonapplause The glistening hope of that lamp is still ours.
nonapplause He said that this was my first visit to Kauai.
nonapplause But if you could deduct $2 800 a year from your taxes -- keep in mind  this is a tax credit  not a deduction.
nonapplause I hope we shall all take new inspiration and resolve from this Conference so that we may the better discharge the enormous privilege of being the elected representatives of our people  especially at a time when democracy is on the move.
nonapplause We have  I think  over 40 members of Congress here and two senators who went back to the floor to fight for this issue to be put on the floor today.
nonapplause But what's important to me is that partisan bickering gave way to bipartisan harmony that lasted the entirety of the administration; indeed  patriotic hymns burst forth from the steps of the Capitol.
nonapplause Unless the President of the United States looks to the future  unless he is willing to set before our country its unfinished business in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt set it before it in the thirties  and Woodrow Wilson before him  unless he is willing to move ahead this country cannot possibly meet its responsibilities to itself and to those who look to us for assistance and help.
nonapplause That is a false choice.
nonapplause Really that rider word is really well chosen because it's sort of an unrelated passenger riding along on a piece of legislation that otherwise looks pretty good.
nonapplause You can look around this house tonight and tell that most of us have been very fortunate  and we as a people have 22 percent of the world's wealth -- with 4 percent of the world's people.
nonapplause We didn't click that day  but a few years later it was Don Rumsfeld who noticed my work and offered me a position in the executive branch.
nonapplause But the bottom line is  is that our combat phase is now over.
nonapplause And in her last year she agreed to chair for me a commission looking at what we should do about the issues of immigration in our country  how we could remain a nation of immigrants and still take a strong stand that people who come here should do so legally.
nonapplause It says: only three things you really need to know about this election.
nonapplause I thread my way through the hospitals
nonapplause It was a second American revolution  and it's only just begun.
nonapplause It made me feel so good I took the rest of the day off.
nonapplause It's a cover  a smokescreen  a well-worn Socialist-Marxist ploy.
nonapplause But when he was installed  back in the '70s  I was a young man starting out in politics  and I -- Arkansas  my home state  still had the largest percentage of people living in the state who were born there.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause To be in trouble with Mr. Hoover was a serious matter.
nonapplause And I got to say  Washington has got a short-term memory  so people don't remember that it wasn't that long ago under a Democratic President that America enjoyed the hard-won budget surpluses.
nonapplause In the last century  generations of Americans and Russians inherited the power to destroy nations  and the understanding that using that power would bring about our own destruction.
nonapplause These are things that are going on in other countries  something that we're battling with here constantly.
nonapplause By the resolve and purpose of America  and of our friends and allies  we will make this an age of progress and liberty.
nonapplause I think philosophers might want to contemplate the question: Why is the freest nation on Earth also the one in which it is so common to see people from every walk of life -- rich and poor  young and old -- rolling up their sleeves and pitching in to help others?
nonapplause I like this audience.
nonapplause We mean to help them.
nonapplause Another important way we can help our young people is by guiding them toward the knowledge and the self-respect they need to build successful lives.
nonapplause And it was important work to do because I was the one who had to clean up after Norm Ornstein explained the political system to the students.
nonapplause They couldn't work outside the home  and little girls in Afghanistan were forbidden to be educated.
nonapplause In fact  he is arrogantly out of touch with reality.
nonapplause The General mentioned 63 years ago today  our nation was attacked at Pearl Harbor.
nonapplause That's another area that needs to be addressed.
nonapplause Your firefighters and police  rescue and recovery workers have responded with true heroism  and the entire nation has been deeply moved by the images of men and women working beyond the point of exhaustion  of parish communities throughout the city and New Yorkers of all faith stepping forward to offer any help that is needed.
nonapplause And I am very proud that there is in this country  embodied in the service of the Democratic governors  a new Democratic Party committed to new ideas and the old principles of opportunity for all  responsibility from all and a community of all Americans.
nonapplause The first challenge being  yes  to articulate the principles and stand for the truths and move forward to fight for the restoration of our constitutional liberties and our sovereignty and moral discipline as a people; and the second priority being to get behind those who are willing to stand with us and fight with us and work with us in order to make it happen--because if we don't get out there and make those election victories happen  every word will be hollow and every hope will be lost.
nonapplause The senators think that -- their legislation  I think  calls for some sort of mandatory 72-hour examination period  including a psychiatric exam.
nonapplause We're three years ahead -- we're three years into it  we're two-thirds of the way done  we're ahead of schedule and under budget.
nonapplause Nearly two centuries ago  Lewis and Clark used this compass -- this very one -- to navigate a continent of possibility.
nonapplause Did you ever buy anything off E-Bay?
nonapplause So  if you're a mayor in Indiana or Wyoming or Wisconsin  why should you care about it?
nonapplause And the challenge of the global economy and the American economy  where there has been so much market value lost  questions of business ethics and around the world  where there's a wholesale assault on globalization by people who say they speak for the world's poor and those of us who support an integrated global economy are hurting them.
nonapplause You can't get by just on your pretty looks.
nonapplause Out of that searing experience  Marion Wiesel summoned the courage to commit her life to teaching others  especially children  about the human cost of hatred  intolerance and racism.
nonapplause It would stop the government from authorizing burials at Arlington Cemetery.
nonapplause Because the polls also indicate that you have the highest percentage in that age group who do not go to the polls to vote.
nonapplause And there have been numerous breakthroughs  and we're all very optimistic.
nonapplause And number two  it's changing so fast  if we don't keep working we can't keep the growth going.
nonapplause Six years ago only 30 percent of the people of Latin America lived in democracies; today over 90 percent do.
nonapplause In fact  in the past decade  all of a sudden  quietly  mysteriously  the Republican Party has become the party of ideas.
nonapplause They never have.
nonapplause You're saying all the right things.
nonapplause That's how we'll make certain that markets foster responsibility  not recklessness.
nonapplause Walking away from this opportunity will not create or save a single American job.
nonapplause They are trying to out-compete us when it comes to clean energy.
nonapplause The sooner that time starts  the better for Britain's unemployed.
nonapplause We need other things  too.
nonapplause So  speak up loudly  and let all America hear.
nonapplause So why are they here?
nonapplause He says he supports the President in these other two areas now."
nonapplause The Points of Light Initiative held up the best in America  reminded us of what we can do when we truly work together.
nonapplause Governor Lawrence  Reverend Clergy  Mrs. Price  ladies and gentlemen: I am very grateful for the Governor's generous remarks  and his kind analogy with Mr. Perry.
nonapplause In the coming days and weeks  I'll be launching other aspects of the plan.
nonapplause Unless you were in our generation  you cannot imagine.
nonapplause And locking them up  the hard-core criminals up  and throwing away the key is the best gun-control law we could ever have.
nonapplause People -- other people can have different views.
nonapplause It all begins with family  with parents who love their children more than life and raise them to live their dreams.
nonapplause And so one of the things that we're trying to do is to put some of the money  if we can get a tobacco settlement  put a big chunk of the money into a research fund that will double funding for the National Cancer Institute  have a huge increase in funding for the National Institute of Health  have a big increase in funding for the National Science Foundation  support the international space station -- just do a whole range of things that will help to prepare the future for our people.
nonapplause Now  you've heard the liberals say they're on your side.
nonapplause Yep.
nonapplause It is great to be in Fremont  good to be back in Northern California.
nonapplause Isn't this nice?
nonapplause You've looked beyond the bottom line and the next quarter to the long-term health of your company.
nonapplause Yes  of course  we do.
nonapplause And again  to use my Grandpop's metaphor  the Recovery Act isn't the horse that's carrying the whole sleigh  but it's pulling its weight.
nonapplause And we have done what we could  over the last eight years  to make sure that our children get the best shot in life by getting their shots.
nonapplause And we must certainly not neglect the vital role parents play in the learning process as well.
nonapplause In fact  it's precisely because of our global responsibilities and your growing and capacity and willingness to meet them with us that we value our partnership with Central Europe and Europe now more than we ever had.
nonapplause The countries of our hemisphere now share a consensus that democracy and economic liberty are the only pathways to success.
nonapplause So what I see in front of me today is people of a different color  different stripes  of different backgrounds  of different beliefs -- all wearing the same uniform.
nonapplause And believe me  this is not an option.
nonapplause Everybody wanted to go invest in the Palestinian areas.
nonapplause And my heart has always been with my wife and my family  with my hometown of Monterrey and with my home state of California.
nonapplause And by nurturing our children  caring for us when we get sick  and looking after the elderly  they -- perhaps more than any others -- give our country its strength and heart.
nonapplause The end of the Cold War.
nonapplause Our criteria should be the same as that expressed by Abe Lincoln  whose birthday we celebrate today.
nonapplause The terrorist threat to freedom is worldwide.
nonapplause That one photograph  taken by Eddie Adams  brought home to everyone of my generation and my parent's generation that despite the promises we had been hearing  there was really no end in sight.
nonapplause In Singapore  we worked with leaders from across the Asia Pacific to strengthen the global economic recovery.
nonapplause But what is interesting about this is that these students buy the preponderance -- most of their music online.
nonapplause It may have occurred to you.
nonapplause Tonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of economic growth  for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9 million new jobs in 3 years  interest rates cut in half  inflation falling over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today  and a mighty river of good works -- a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone.
nonapplause The practical impact means that a lot of that money won't be taken care of  and we will reduce the amount of money we're spending for police and for prevention programs.
nonapplause And even though they were loyal Republican partisans  they were more loyal to the Constitution  and they resigned on principle rather than implement what they saw as abuses of power by Nixon.
nonapplause Sure   You remember that a Levite   Sure   and a priest passed by on the other side; they didn't stop to help him.
nonapplause Have you noticed that?
nonapplause But if we do  then I think we need have no fear.
nonapplause All of these measures leave money in the hands of middle-class taxpayers who earned it ?- but Senator Kerry voted "no."
nonapplause What's the point of all this?
nonapplause This isn't surprising when you consider their record.
nonapplause All these forms of religious expression and worship are permitted and protected by the First Amendment.
nonapplause There especially  the fight for freedom should still be our own.
nonapplause I want all of you to listen to this.
nonapplause I'm always happy to return  and I have to say that I've never seen the city looking better than it does today.
nonapplause President Bush understands  as Ronald Reagan did  that if history teaches anything  it teaches self-delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly.
nonapplause Couldn't have done it.
nonapplause To build one America with freedom and justice for all  we should pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
nonapplause Every midterm election in the 20th century except one -- when President Roosevelt could not pass Social Security in 1934 -- every other one has seen a loss in both Houses  or at least one House  for the President in power  his party.
nonapplause Third  I call on the private sector to help us meet one of the greatest challenges of electronic commerce: ensuring that we develop effective methods of protecting the privacy of every American  especially children who use the Internet.
nonapplause I have a deep  personal commitment to achieving an arms reduction agreement at the negotiations in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces.
nonapplause He's the man who saved the city of Cleveland  a guy who knows what it means to do what's right and to do it right.
nonapplause But you never could identify the symbolic meaning of those bones—how they were dead because they had been cut off from their own kind.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause I know that these days--actually  I've noticed that it's almost becoming acceptable now for people to admit that they talk to God.
nonapplause And we know that's only going to become a more pronounced trend.
nonapplause Our economy is growing again instead of shrinking.
nonapplause The price of freedom's high  but as far as I'm concerned  it's not too high  and we're going to pay it.
nonapplause And I still do.
nonapplause No American should be deprived of that dignity.
nonapplause I'm sure there was somebody who was dissatisfied with it at the time.
nonapplause And I believe that imposes upon us a very heavy responsibility.
nonapplause What they know is that when Jerry Ford left office -- the end of 1976 -- the prime interest rate was 6\1/4\ percent.
nonapplause It is now true that on any given day  there is $1.5 trillion of currency exchange in the world.
nonapplause We moved beyond the sterile debate between those who said government was the problem and those who said it was the solution  to a new way  a new government for the Information Age that gives our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives  that is unashamedly a catalyst for new ideas where the old ones don't work  that is a good partner with the private sector.
nonapplause When you get to the federal government  we -- it's no longer millions or billions  it's trillions at the federal government.
nonapplause And yet  at the same time  we launched the most comprehensive series of arms reduction proposals in our nation's history.
nonapplause You see  since becoming President  I've been able to visit Alabama not once or twice  but six times.
nonapplause Their parents speak over 100 different languages as their native language.
nonapplause Over the past four years  the United States has faced terrorist attacks  military conflict abroad  and a series of tough challenges to our economy  beginning with the recession of 2001.
nonapplause Thank you and God bless you.
nonapplause As General Petraeus said  "the way ahead will be neither quick nor easy  and there will undoubtedly be tough days.
nonapplause If we make the right choices  we can reach the day in the next few years when seven in ten Americans live in their own homes and family incomes rise by one-third.
nonapplause Now we're not out of the woods yet  but Mr. Trimble dodged a bullet this week and we still have work to do.
nonapplause But we enjoyed very much -- I enjoyed my service in the Congress.
nonapplause Then if America's moral identity  if our common ground as a people  rests upon this premise of God's existence and God's authority  who  if not the people of God who are called by His name  will stand up to bear witness to its truth in our public life  in our deliberations  in our politics  in our legislatures  in our lives?
nonapplause And we'll make sure the difference goes to the hospitals that need it most.
nonapplause He skidded into a tree.
nonapplause They wish they never had.
nonapplause In our meeting today  Admiral Prueher  the Commander-in-Chief of our Pacific Command and General Tilelli  the Commander of U.S.
nonapplause And I promise you this.
nonapplause We want to pool government and private sector resources through positive incentives and enterprise zones so that we can harness the power and creativity of the marketplace.
nonapplause I hope that you will make a decision in these coming elections that is consistent with keeping on this course  because it is working.
nonapplause The propaganda of the American government is skillfully designed to make our people think that our people back home don't want us.

nonapplause Given that it is administration policy  we have to take that into account as a nation in looking at the likely consequences of an overwhelming American military victory against the government of Iraq.
nonapplause But I do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first; how to let doctors focus on practicing medicine; how to encourage broader use of evidence-based guidelines.

nonapplause I see it based on his comments during the course of this campaign.
nonapplause It's so bad that the budget would be in balance today and we'd have more money to give California for defense conversion  but the interest rate we pay on the debt run up between 1981 and the day I became President has thrown us into a deficit this year.
nonapplause Now we're going to have a balanced budget sometime in the next year  and it's projected we'll have a trillion dollars in surpluses over the next decade -- more than enough money  if we do some other things to fix the Social Security system for the younger people listening here today.
nonapplause We will be partners in helping to alleviate poverty.
nonapplause And then there's the unseen cost which is harder to calculate but nonetheless devastating: Regulation tends to smother innovation  discourage new investment  increase labor costs  and reduce competition.

nonapplause You know  in my country and generally in Western culture  when someone waves a white handkerchief  it's a symbol of military surrender.
nonapplause Some have  clearly  already discarded their old missions and assumed new roles.
nonapplause The people who carried this torch all across America show us exactly how that spirit can lift all our lives every day.
nonapplause We're not going to stand for watching more children abandoned because we don't give them health care.
nonapplause I don't hold that view at all.
nonapplause Another great honor comes by virtue of legislation signed by the President.
nonapplause And while I serve in the Senate -- and I mean no disrespect to my Senate colleagues here today -- as the President of the Senate  my heart will always be in the House.
nonapplause The way to progress is to do as we do and that's to start with 180 million free Americans and work up to the Federal Government.

nonapplause If we turn a blind eye to our weak economy it will eventually undermine everything else that we're trying to accomplish  whether it's winning the war against terrorism or giving all families the economic opportunities that they deserve.
nonapplause I'm glad you're here.
nonapplause And I think it's clear to me now  looking back  that the fights we waged to try to be pro-competitive  pro-entrepreneur in that rather herculean legislative battle  had even more positive impacts than I had imagined they would.
nonapplause Next month Secretary Bennett will turn in to me a homework assignment -- yes  even Cabinet members have homework assignments -- one that I gave him last March  asking for a status report on American education.
nonapplause But they may also tell you that making a difference abroad might just be the thing that inspires you to come back and make a difference here at home.
nonapplause It can be the beginning of clearing the air.
nonapplause They are on the subject of housing and rates and pensions.
nonapplause Almost a year-and-a-half ago  we announced a Federal campaign for a drug free workplace.
nonapplause Mr. Chairman  it isn't Government's job to run industry.

nonapplause Now  Representative Johnson has been a strong advocate for Social Security beneficiaries.
nonapplause The wound will fester  and the infection will break out once again.
nonapplause Well  in the last two years  we gave 24 states permission to get around federal rules and regulations to find new ways to put people to work  to give them a chance in life.
nonapplause And all these scenarios are real  by the way.
nonapplause That has to be our party.
nonapplause It was 12.4 percent.
nonapplause And in each successive election in Iraq going back to January a year ago there's been less violence  broader participation  and bigger voter turnout.
nonapplause And they're not foolish people.
nonapplause For decades and decades  the American people have been denied something that every other advanced country provides to its citizens -- the security of knowing that they have good health care that is always there.
nonapplause Many times I'm sure there were doubts and lots of discouragement  and it took real courage to carry on.

nonapplause This is all encouraging.
nonapplause We knew that our national system of military defense had been weakened.
nonapplause Mr. Mondale claimed he would keep America strong.
nonapplause We put billions aside also for emergencies  as do other states  but not here in Washington.
nonapplause That's what they have to do.
nonapplause Yet we lost nearly 3 000 Americans at the hands of 19 men armed with box cutters and airline tickets.
nonapplause They knew what dangers can follow when government either dictates or frustrates the exercise of religion.
nonapplause The first truth is the old reliable: People who live in glass houses should never throw stones.
nonapplause So we've got a good program there.
nonapplause The Democratic Congress passed a housing bill last year which I think would have met the needs of our economy  the needs of our people  and that bill was vetoed.
nonapplause All of you have cared a great deal about making democracy work for all Americans.
nonapplause We decided  no  we're going to take a different approach.
nonapplause And then for 3 nights straight  he dreamed of the number five.
nonapplause No-one is in any doubt about that.
nonapplause And so  totalitarian Nicaragua poses a threat to us all.
nonapplause It's critical to all of us.
nonapplause They offer us the hope of a peaceful future and new trading partners  new prosperity  new opportunities to enrich our own lives by learning from different cultures and ethnic groups.
nonapplause Now  even here  you could say it's a mixed picture.
nonapplause That's what they were about.
nonapplause And there are too few partners to get the job done.
nonapplause You have people every single week choosing between food and medicine.
nonapplause Okay  I'm game if you are.
nonapplause Before the end of the century  many billions of dollars of commercial activity will be taking place in and because of space.
nonapplause We now see that some of the disinfectants we use to protect our water can actually combine with natural substances to create harmful compounds.
nonapplause So  one thing that I think we have to remember is that the budget deficit at the end of 1982  whether we meet our target exactly or not -- and we're determined to keep on trying that we will -- would have been $35 billion bigger than it will be because that's how much we got in the package of cuts that have already been adopted.
nonapplause No one group in this country is better than another.
nonapplause Senator Kerry's voting record on national security raises some important questions all by itself.
nonapplause You just think about it.
nonapplause I believe we're moving in the right direction.
nonapplause So we must come from the places where we pray and worship  where with groanings we call upon the Lord to bless our nation and save it from these evils  in order to become--with our voices  with our votes  with our courageous stands on the hustings  and on the bench  and in the public square--we must become the hand of its salvation  the word of its salvation  the voice of His healing for our land.
nonapplause He became injury- and accident-prone.
nonapplause To coin a proverb  a country which trusts the talent of its people makes a sound investment indeed.
nonapplause We now know that our failure to forge and to lead a true coalition has forced thousands in the National Guard and Reserves to be away from families and jobs for more than a year with no end in sight.
nonapplause And they had a rope in there  and finally he began swinging on the rope for them and doing a few tricks.
nonapplause Well  thank you  sir.
nonapplause But it is obvious that an acceptable solution for Angola is only possible if all outside powers withdraw their military support.
nonapplause It would be hard to find many Americans who aren't aware of our stake in the Middle East  the Persian Gulf  or the NATO line dividing the free world from the Communist bloc.
nonapplause Now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms  though arms we need -- not as a call to battle  though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle  year in and year out  rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation  a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny  poverty  disease  and war itself.
nonapplause Last fall  at the President's request  Congress considered legislation providing critical funding for our troops -- for body armor and other vital support  such as hazard pay  ammunition  jet fuel  vehicles  and spare parts.
nonapplause And when people say it's all due to unemployment  may I point out that crime in the United States is good deal worse than here?
nonapplause Well  let us pray that this should come to pass.
nonapplause I'm delighted to be joined by Senator Pryor  about whom I would like to say more in a moment; Congressman Snyder  Congressman Ross and a large number of people who came here with me from Washington.
nonapplause You're part of an American tradition of neighbor helping neighbor; you're keeping it alive and making it grow.
nonapplause Can't be temporary.
nonapplause Therefore  what I would say to you is that this age of interdependence  like every age that is preceded before in human history has good and bad points.
nonapplause All that is necessary  according to our president  is that he  the president  label any citizen an unlawful enemy combatant and that will be sufficient to justify taking away that citizen's liberty without due process  even for the rest of his life if the president so chooses.
nonapplause I want to bring our country together  and I want to preserve the leadership of America as the world's greatest force for peace and freedom and democracy.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause No to clean energy jobs.
nonapplause A classic example is the identification of the cystic fibrosis gene  which should help to reduce the incidence of that terrible disease.
nonapplause And we've already created the first ever government-wide task force on childhood obesity.
nonapplause For as much as government can do  and must do  it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause And all along the way  at various times  the choice will be more difficult for people.
nonapplause That is America's great genius.
nonapplause Yes  as you've been told  he's number two in the House minority leadership  and I pray that someday soon  we will be saying  the House majority leadership.
nonapplause We're going to do what's necessary to protect the American people  to determine who is behind this potentially deadly act  and to see that justice is done.
nonapplause Cut our defences  you add still more unemployment to the 200 000 jobs or job opportunities already lost by Labour's defence reductions.
nonapplause And we're going to work so that those rates continue to decline  and I think they're going to start doing that soon  and our economy will become synonymous with economic growth.
nonapplause Because you can get the exercise you need from walking your dog vigorously  running with your dog  doing some push-ups at home  or just playing.
nonapplause Well  I believe the business community's been milked and shot at long enough.
nonapplause So just before she was announced  but after I had discussed the appointment with her  I was told that this matter had come up.
nonapplause It is also why restoring common sense and decency to our criminal justice system is equally vital.
nonapplause So it's not easy.
nonapplause Under Attorney General Reno's leadership  the Justice Department has taken aim at hate crimes with more prosecutions and tougher punishments.
nonapplause Today the low and stable inflation we enjoy has been critical to our economic health  and low inflation has also contributed to that of many other nations as well.
nonapplause Do they think that mortgage companies being able to steer you to unaffordable mortgages are a smart thing to do?
nonapplause And after the recent earthquake in South Asia  the entire world watched as thousands of Muslims  deep in the observance of Ramadan  led the relief effort without breaking their fast.
nonapplause Second  I want us to set an example of humility.
nonapplause This is a strange time in the life of any administration  but I think this short film will show that I have come to terms with it.
nonapplause What they reflect is the ambivalence  the fears people have about the globalization of the world economy and the explosion of information and technology and science  and how it's bringing us all closer together.
nonapplause We're children of the same God.
nonapplause And thank you  Mr. Vice President  for your support and your guidance over these past four years.
nonapplause You think about how much of your life  your own life  is organized around that one-tenth of one percent.
nonapplause We have a minority home ownership gap in America.
nonapplause So I'm asking you to take what you know in your heart  your mind  and your life as truth and say to the Congress of the United States  the time to act is now and we will support you.
nonapplause Some kids are in college.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at Bush-Cheney 2004 Luncheon
nonapplause And I hope that the full House and Senate will follow their lead and protect social security for years to come by showing the same bipartisanship.
nonapplause And if you can see in this some difference between what this person contemplates and what the Nazis did  then you have better eyes than I.
nonapplause This Caribbean Initiative is not a charity program.
nonapplause And I'm going to do some planting  too  here.
nonapplause It demands the extension of nationalisation so widely that more than half of all British workers would be working for the State.
nonapplause We have the lowest crime rate in over 25 years now.
nonapplause We must eliminate unproductive tax shelters.
nonapplause You know you're going to hear something persuasive and moving  historically literate  intellectually honest.
nonapplause The Mayor of that small community was just on television  and I had a visit with him a few moments ago.
nonapplause But we do have one state  Hawaii  who 20 years ago decided that there ought to be shared responsibility  a 50-50 deal --employers pay half of health insurance and employees pay half of it  and everybody get covered.
nonapplause And when times are tough  it can be easy to give in to cynicism and it can be easy to give in to fear; to set our sights lower; to settle for the status quo; to pit people against each other; to find wedge issues; to focus on those things that appear to give a tactical advantage but have nothing to do with whether or not our country is going to be successful over the long term.
nonapplause Our response to that?
nonapplause That is what we owe to our children and our grandchildren.
nonapplause I'm sure that if we had the time to talk  a lot of folks would say  "Well  Mr. Nixon  you've traveled a lot.
nonapplause However  I can assure all of you that the great economic expansion our country has enjoyed has had more to do with low tax rates  deregulation  and responsible Federal policies than with leprechauns.
nonapplause By 1947 the gross national product held steady and then increased by 4 percent.
nonapplause Well  I can't.
nonapplause My relationship with President Fox is similar to the relationship between our nations.
nonapplause And it made a searing impression on me.
nonapplause There are real  significant differences here.
nonapplause It sounds strange; it's basically normal trade authority for the President or his representative to make an agreement with another country about tearing down trade barriers  which then the Congress gets to vote on  but they have to vote it up or down.
nonapplause And I pledge to you that America will continue to be the strongest nation in the world militarily so that we can keep the peace for all the world.
nonapplause You've been focused and tireless.
nonapplause They've got plenty.
nonapplause Some say that all that's lacking is political will.
nonapplause I don't want them to still be suffering from spiraling costs that we did not stem  or sicknesses that we did not cure.
nonapplause It would have been a mistake  of course  to lose my temper.
nonapplause Inflation is low.
nonapplause Now  we know there will be those who will go right ahead.
nonapplause I must say that I do not think that we probably demonstrated in that forty years that we are angels yet  but I hope we have demonstrated that we are at least friends.
nonapplause That was the philosophy of the last administration and their friends in Congress.
nonapplause We have to learn to deal with AIDS better for all of our people  and for those who are here within our borders who are not citizens  we've got all we can do to do that.
nonapplause The micro chips  the computer hardware  and software  the deep-sea drilling rigs and mining machinery.
nonapplause Well  who put it up to what it was to halve it from?
nonapplause The air is cleaner  the water is cleaner  the food is safer.
nonapplause But today  I want every American to know about the difference you've made -- especially in recent months and days.
nonapplause A lot of what we're doing in these tsunami-affected countries could be done for poor people everywhere in the world.
nonapplause "We have discovered dozens of WMD-related program activities and significant amount of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations during the inspections that began in late 2002.
nonapplause In 1932 and 1933  and 1934 and 1935  there were those who saw no future for Tennessee  or parts of North Carolina or Virginia.
nonapplause You don't have to be a genius to figure out we've got to sell something to the other 96 percent of the people if we're going to maintain our standard of living.
nonapplause You know  one of my great achievements as president was that I finally found a tax cut the Republicans didn't like.
nonapplause So I look forward to working with the members of the House and the Senate to pass power out of Washington  to provide flexibility for the federal funds so that the governors  superintendents  principals can design programs that meet your specific needs.
nonapplause We must carry this message around the world  and what is the message  and that brings me right back to where we began.
nonapplause By the end of this century it is predicted that several more countries will have acquired nuclear weapons.
nonapplause ﻿  Mrs. Bush's Remarks At Bush-Cheney '04 Event in West Allis  Wisconsin
nonapplause I want to say again  the remarkable thing about this effort was that at the time we actually got it through the Congress  there was not a single dissenting vote.
nonapplause And you know  as I know  that we can have the best jobs and the finest social security system and the best health care and the finest education that we can possibly devise; and it isn't going to make any difference if we are not around to enjoy it.
nonapplause Well  we set to work to change all that.
nonapplause If your church  your synagogue or mosque  you're looking for something to do  find a program that will help mentor a child.
nonapplause The military is a priority of mine  starting with making sure people get better pay and better housing.
nonapplause And let me tell you: If we must ever ask them to put their lives on the line for the United States of America  then they deserve to have the finest weapons and equipment that money can buy.
nonapplause I watched President Ford  as I worked for him  come in after Watergate  one of the most serious crises the nation had faced since the Civil War  in terms of our constitutional system  watched him by the sheer force of his personality and his character and his decency restore trust and confidence in the White House.
nonapplause And I think if people understood that  Al Gore and Joe Lieberman would win -- don't you?
nonapplause And I'd just like to mention two things if I might.
nonapplause So we had this incredible meeting on health care.
nonapplause I was here next in 1956 and I'm here again in 1960.
nonapplause We appreciate you being here.
nonapplause I've spent large numbers of days there.
nonapplause If only the Government had told us the truth and shamed the Left.
nonapplause Their party's against funding it; our party's for it.
nonapplause If President Bush appoints a moderate to the Supreme Court  we won't say he sold out the right.
nonapplause They pay their bills.
nonapplause We have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges.
nonapplause Today  more than one in seven African Americans are out of work -- the highest in nearly a quarter century.
nonapplause Over the last three years  our country has faced some of the toughest challenges in our history.
nonapplause If Jesse had known Rodney was going to read for him --   -- he probably would have come back --   -- for fear that Rodney would read it better than he would.
nonapplause The debate is about to be joined.
nonapplause A new generation of Muslims is coming to age  more numerous than its predecessors  more dispersed geographically  and because of technology  more closely connected with each other and with the forces and events that shape the world we share.
nonapplause General Keistlier  General Rizak  General Austin  ladies and gentlemen -- it's a great honor for me to be here today with the men and women of the 126th Air Refueling Wing and its supporting units  the 217th Engineering and Installation Squadron  the 264th Combat Communications Squadron  the 566th Air Force Band  with all the families and friends.
nonapplause And I guess it's the same as it was  but when I left office  we were  for example  giving -- 85 percent of all the immunizations in the state of Arkansas were being given by the county health departments.
nonapplause The only other thing I'd like to say is this.
nonapplause Our aim is to enable each of us to go home from this Conference with a clear picture of the whole range of measures which are available to reduce demand for drugs.
nonapplause The Russians are doing a good job  actually  of trying to preserve their democracy with a whole lot of different ethnic groups.
nonapplause But the simple fact that you are all here shows that you're already beating those odds.
nonapplause We want more people owning their own home.
nonapplause None of that's in there.
nonapplause The first has been the enormous increase in numbers at every level of education and a demand for more of everything throughout from nursery right up to university training.
nonapplause Last year -- and we all know how bad last year was  and  again  these are just preliminary figures -- Americans  as individuals  contributed $48.7 billion  an increase of 9.4 percent over 1981.
nonapplause But I loved representing Wyoming and the people of Wyoming.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause Children who are behind schedule or who don't have records will be referred to a local health care provider.
nonapplause Mr. President  as a citizen  as a parent  and as a grandparent  let me thank you for calling this White House Leadership Conference on Youth  Drug Use and Violence.
nonapplause For all of the achievements we can point to  these are not the best of times for many high-tech companies  or for our economy.
nonapplause So that's why I'm pleased today to sign into law a bill that will strengthen American manufacturing and American jobs.
nonapplause He and I  along with Senator Al Simpson  constituted Wyoming's congressional delegation during the entire Reagan presidency.
nonapplause But most important  in our hearts we must make your world a home for all its children.
nonapplause And some people even argued that what you all were trying to do here was somehow “un-American.”
nonapplause Not Megawati.
nonapplause Men who were poor and African American  without resources and with few alternatives  they believed they had found hope when they were offered free medical care by the United States Public Health Service.
nonapplause And this coalition is also going to extend opportunities to all of our young people  and that includes efforts to open doors for women and minorities  who all too often have been underrepresented in scientific fields but who are no less capable of success in scientific careers.
nonapplause You know  I was campaigning in Chicago and somebody asked me  is there ever any time where the budget might have to go into deficit?
nonapplause And I also can't thank you enough for promoting baseball as the American pastime.
nonapplause The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2 percent  which means it's the best it's been in more than 14 years.
nonapplause And deep down within them  you perceive a desire for self-destruction  a kind of suicidal longing.
nonapplause Going forward now  as we build a stronger  safer  healthier America  an important component of that  obviously  has to always be that we are also doing whatever is necessary to make certain that we've adequately provided for the defense of the country  to safeguard the homeland  and to protect ourselves against future attacks.
nonapplause There are many things I could mention at home  but I would just say two things.
nonapplause What a great moment we have before us  and  oh  how future generations will dishonor us if now in a moment of sudden folly we throw it all away.
nonapplause Its hold even today on the American people is easy to understand.
nonapplause Maybe we should come up with some new ideas to see if we can plot a new direction for the party.
nonapplause And so this is an education program that's based upon principles.
nonapplause The check you will receive in the mail represents your benefit from the newest lowest rate  which drops from 15 percent to 10 percent.
nonapplause Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them -- despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence.
nonapplause Altogether  this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economy by more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keeping records nearly half a century ago.
nonapplause We also must invest in the physical infrastructure of the information age.
nonapplause In these challenging times  the world has seen the resolve and the courage of America.
nonapplause The appalling and tragic events which we have witnessed recently in Peking reminded us that although democracy is spreading  is gaining ground throughout the world  there are still enormous risks and dangers and some of the old terrible tyrannies with the attitudes which to us belong to the past still remain today and are active.
nonapplause And then there's Shantell Steve  from my hometown of Chicago  Illinois.
nonapplause We have been through the fire of decision.
nonapplause I want this to be a journey  not a destination.
nonapplause All things which one needs if we are to achieve the unity of the people of Europe which the Treaty of Rome envisaged.
nonapplause I don't know the nature of the conversation --   -- but I'm hoping that they will do the right thing.
nonapplause This will advance not the economic interests of the middle class  it will not restore the American Dream  it will not help the poor to work their way into prosperity  it will simply achieve some short-term gains in order to finance either spending cuts or tax cuts to upper- income Americans.
nonapplause Now  think of what reducing the prime interest rate by over half means to young families seeking to purchase a new home.
nonapplause I agree with their conclusion that the terrorists were able to exploit "deep institutional failings" in our nation's defenses that developed over more than a decade.
nonapplause I believe that great opportunities do lie ahead to overcome the age-old menaces of disease and hunger and want.
nonapplause That's what we're going to go out and do: get off our rear ends and go out and make this country right and get the job done.
nonapplause They're beginning to understand that they need to step up and be responsible citizens if they want to live in peace and a free society.
nonapplause The effect of this vote was to rest the hopes for peace and democracy in Central America purely and simply on the word of the Communist regime in Managua.
nonapplause The same thing is true in Asia.
nonapplause I mean one of the things I'll tell you one thing that he and I agreed on and therefore it never got any publicity  somebody asked me about...
nonapplause That means that our military -- active duty  National Guard  and Reserves -- must have every tool to answer any threat that may emerge against us.
nonapplause You cannot afford to get that done by yourself; together  we can fund that kind of research.
nonapplause And then he was all over the lot.
nonapplause We have tried to do it differently in the primary schools.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech to Conservative Party Conference
nonapplause Look  our administration believes fiercely in the willingness and the capacity of American workers to work -- that's what they want to do.
nonapplause And for many in this great state  the road to a brighter future will run through a community college.
nonapplause We will also explore opportunities  as the Israelis are  for progress between Israel and Syria.
nonapplause That is the challenge facing the world financial system today.
nonapplause So if you get into trouble  that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker  it means you need to try harder to act right.
nonapplause This reluctance to use those vast resources at our command reminds me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the Blitz.
nonapplause In the last session we actually got a lot of -- a substantial amount of money through the Congress for after-school programs for kids who would otherwise be wandering on the streets or for work programs for kids who are out of school.
nonapplause You might have heard about a treaty that would place American troops under the jurisdiction of something called the International Criminal Court.
nonapplause And Mr Whitelaw set out our policies and their purpose.
nonapplause You know  I've been collecting stories that I know are told in Russia by the Russian people  and I can confirm that.
nonapplause But I just want you to know that every time I see another economic report like the one we saw yesterday  that the economy grew another 3.5 percent in the last quarter; every time I think about the 13 million people who have jobs  the 3 million people who aren't on welfare  the more than 12 million people who have taken advantage of family and medical leave  and all of the achievements that this administration has played a role in  I know -- I know that one of the most important factors was the unique and unprecedented relationship I have enjoyed with this fine  good man.
nonapplause And all of us deeply love this beautiful ideal that is America.
nonapplause Now  what makes them think that raising the taxes now will not do the same thing  that that is an answer  to go back to the same things that they've been doing  put the money supply on a rollercoaster  going up and going down  inflation skyrocketing.
nonapplause Fremont lost thousands of jobs as the NUMMI auto plant slowed production and shut down -- and that hurt not only autoworkers but local businesses and parts suppliers.
nonapplause And this  we knew  would enhance the chances for world peace.
nonapplause We would like them to visit our countries just as we can go to theirs.
nonapplause It is great to be back in Colorado.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause And so I say to you  my fellow Americans  you are pointing the way to the future.
nonapplause The deep canyons  rugged mountains and isolated buttes of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon tell a story written over the course of billions of years  illustrated in colorful vistas and spectacular detail.
nonapplause No  you're not.
nonapplause Vote for him  he wins.
nonapplause Make new friends; get to know your classmates.
nonapplause Our nation hasn't always lived up to its ideals  yet those ideals have never ceased to guide us.
nonapplause It was one smeltering summer Sunday evening  and the minister in our little church mounted the pulpit and announced that he was going to preach the shortest sermon he had ever given.
nonapplause We believe we know how to handle them.
nonapplause You're welcome.
nonapplause And I want everybody to know that everybody here -- at every level -- is working night and day to end this crisis.
nonapplause But I should have been at one of these conferences a long -- well  years ago.
nonapplause It has protected Social Security and Medicare.
nonapplause In part  this is because the old strategy -- including the Constellation program -- was not fulfilling its promise in many ways.
nonapplause Let me tell you one other story of Sandinista religious repression.
nonapplause I spoke to her last night in Singapore to congratulate her on this remarkable achievement.
nonapplause We will hear a lot of it again in the Senate and the House.
nonapplause It's not just this woman you like  it will affect people's lives how she votes.
nonapplause And our job is to hand you an America that is free in a country -- or a world that is at peace.
nonapplause And I look forward to working with Congress and the American people to get this budget passed.
nonapplause Make no mistake about it  it was not economic difficulty and the declining value of currency which made foreign good cheaper  which precipitated the present crisis in steel.
nonapplause But I think what a lot of Americans seem to have forgotten is that is not just a statement that we here in this room know  it is also the statement that is the great foundation stone of all our freedom and all our hopes as a people.
nonapplause I recommend to you a poem written by Clark Mollenhoff  the journalist who was part of the White House press corps.
nonapplause ﻿  Rally in Minneapolis
nonapplause And they don't have to say who exactly the Americans for Prosperity are.
nonapplause Can't happen.
nonapplause That means rejecting the false choice that pits the economy against the environment.
nonapplause Keith Joseph and George Younger have some very exciting plans to improve the school curriculum and to raise standards in our schools.
nonapplause He was then the Chairman of the House Budget Committee  perhaps the most powerful member of the House at that time  except the Speaker.

nonapplause We now have 105 communities that have qualified to be empowerment zones or enterprise communities.
nonapplause Through their control of mass media  they revised the doctrine of white supremacy.
nonapplause Just one dictator remains  and the world long ago lost all interest in his five-year plans and four-hour speeches.
nonapplause This means the world to me.
nonapplause And here's a man leading the Serbs saying we have to find a way to reconcile the different ethnic groups.
nonapplause They are restless and seek relief.
nonapplause I know we have to grow the economy  but how can we do it and preserve our precious environmental heritage so that America as we know it will still be around for our grandchildren?
nonapplause But he stubbornly refuses to admit it.
nonapplause But a government-backed Treasury bill gets a greater rate of return than the money that we've got in the federal government.
nonapplause Yet the branches of this network share the same basic ideology and the same dark vision for the world.
nonapplause Well  one of the best job programs we can have is a great national drive to expand exports  and that's part of our program.
nonapplause Our soldiers -- what is important to understand is that when we talk about that  whether it's John Murtha or myself  we allow for the over-horizon capacity to deal with Al Qaida  we allow for the over- horizon capacity to be able to respond to Iran or other threats to our country.
nonapplause There's one thing that all of us have in common: However much sometimes we disagree  and however much sometimes it's difficult  we all know there is no other way forward.
nonapplause I think we all know that I had the great good fortune to bring to the American people some new ideas and a new direction at a time when they were open to hearing it.
nonapplause She's toured widely in this country and abroad  teaming with such greats as Louis Armstrong  Count Basie  and Duke Elllington.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President and the Vice President to the People of Knoxville
nonapplause On this issue we must act not as Republicans -- or not as Democrats  but as Americans.
nonapplause Right now  Medicare is supposed to go broke in 15 years  Social Security is supposed to go broke in 33 years  34 years.
nonapplause Iraq is far from the only policy where the president has made bold assertions about the need for dramatic change in policy  change that he has said is mandated by controversial assertions differing radically from accepted views of reality in that particular policy area.
nonapplause Once in a while I watch the evening news  and I'm usually working when it's on -- once in a while I watch it  and I see the way we're presented  and I look at that and I say  well  heck  if I was still back home I wouldn't be for that guy either.
nonapplause You know  for those of us in public life oftentimes are honored to be able to see the best of America  to be able to find true strength  the true heart of the country.
nonapplause That will be a commitment of my administration.
nonapplause Also  I want to thank the President of Mahar Tool Company  Michael Kane.
nonapplause Last year  at this time  President Clinton took the initial report and held it up and said to the country -- everywhere it says the President should  this President will.
nonapplause On the child support enforcement  all the governors  even the most pro-state's rights governors  have understood and supported our efforts to have national standards of child support enforcement.
nonapplause And we could go around the country and find thousands of similar examples.
nonapplause I say this to make the following point: The bill that is on the books will work  given the right economy and the right kind of support systems  but we need to do more than fully implement it  we need to do that and go beyond.
nonapplause It has been so nice to call this city our second home.

nonapplause We must find a way for people to succeed in the work place and succeed in raising their children  and do both.

nonapplause I spoke to young students at Beijing University.
nonapplause The Senate Republicans  to their credit  restored several of these cuts.

nonapplause With AGOA we are sending the message loud and clear that political and economic liberty are the keys to success.

nonapplause But at the end of the day  when it comes time to act  when it comes time to actually make the changes that will make our kids healthier  it's going to take folks like you -- leaders in our community  folks who do the hard work on the ground to actually make the changes that will make a difference in our children's lives.
nonapplause And this is where he and I definitely differ.
nonapplause And let there be no doubt  the forces of freedom will defeat the forces of terror.
nonapplause But the one thing that I will leave office feeling more strongly than I did even on the day I took the Oath of Office  almost eight years ago  is that the true greatness of America resides not in its leaders  but in its citizens.
nonapplause And I had her Bible that I could place my hand on when I took the oath of office in 1980.
nonapplause And the story is familiar to all of you.
nonapplause I think he's gone  but the prime minister of Mauritius committed his country to host and sponsor an international meeting on poverty elimination in 2006.
nonapplause And so  I say again  I think -- you heard what Steve said about Safeway figuring out there was a market here.
nonapplause And so I say to you today  consider our programs  consider what we say  but above all  you must consider the men  their record and we in that respect I would add this final point.
nonapplause I could not disagree more.
nonapplause Some of these representatives are heavily involved in assisting those who've lost jobs because of the current recession.
nonapplause First  in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws  I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior -- for if we want a lasting peace  then the words of the international community must mean something.
nonapplause But looking around this room I see old friends -- Tommy Thomas right there.
nonapplause The world is daily changing before our eyes.
nonapplause And as we do  as we work with you  we'll stick with our ideals.

nonapplause We intend to make good use of every day that we have the honor of serving the American people.
nonapplause But they're willing to let minimum wage workers fall to their lowest real incomes in 40 years?
nonapplause And we're actively and aggressively training security forces so that they'll eventually be able to take over their own responsibilities for securing their country and dealing with the bad actors who still remain from the old regime  as well as the other types of terrorists that are operating out of Iraq.
nonapplause With this power  economic  military  that I have described  we need also a strong diplomatic policy  a diplomatic policy which  again  recognizes the kind of men we're dealing with.
nonapplause I guess what I'm trying to say is that Dothan has given me a gift today  the gift of returning to the real America  and for that I thank you.
nonapplause And yet  no amount of bronze can capture the measure of the man who helped to cut a path for our nation  who personally forged the principles that continue to guide us as Americans and as lovers of freedom.
nonapplause In the past five years  you've done all that's asked of Americans who hope to pursue a dream of owning their own business -- you've taken a risk on a good idea  you've worked hard for your success  you've met your responsibilities to your employees and your customers.
nonapplause But we must be ready  as full military partners  to confront threats to our common security.
nonapplause I want to be clear: We won't overcome our unemployment challenge in just a few hours this afternoon.
nonapplause He refers to the fight in Iraq as the "third world war " and he knows the stakes as well as we do.

nonapplause I chose men and women of talent and integrity  highly qualified nominees who represent the mainstream of American law and American values.
nonapplause I saw three children  teenage children  with a woman and another child taking care of them.
nonapplause Kill as many as you want -- nobody will do anything; and if you run them out of your country  the rich countries will take care of them  anyway; just ethnically cleanse everyplace so you will never have to think about or look at or consider the interest of anybody that's the slightest bit different from you.
nonapplause So I say to you  keep America strong at home  militarily and economically; but above all see that our young people grow up with the burning faith in our country  in her ideals  recognizing that America is a first-rate country in every respect and not second rate  recognizing that American ideals caught the imagination of the world 180 years ago in the American Revolution and that the American Revolution still goes forward and that it is the American Revolution  not the Communist revolution  that is the way of the future.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause And if I might  I would also like to recognize as a group the recipients of the Presidential Awards for Design Excellence  given every four years by the national government's General Services Administration  to celebrate excellence in federal design -- the things your government builds with your tax money.

nonapplause While I was taking our message around the country  you were taking it to the most important level of all -- the grassroots.
nonapplause They go to the security of our children.
nonapplause I was amazed the other day--and my chief of staff Lou Ann Linehan  and I've never mentioned this to her  but chiefs of staff have hard lives.
nonapplause To bring to bear our best efforts to meet the long-term challenges of this country  and not to forget that more than a billion people in this old world of ours still live on less than a dollar a day; and that there are people  not only at home  but around the world  that the United States ought to be lifting up.
nonapplause For one thing  if our plan prevails over the Republican plan  we're going to pay the debt of this country down to its lowest point since before World War I over the next 15 years.
nonapplause And that's the job before you and those students in Moscow for the remainder of this century and into the next one: to bring peoples of other cultures together in that common bond of humanity and to understand that the best way to do this is to stand forthrightly for the values of our whole way of life and what it is based upon  to speak for freedom  to argue the cause for democracy  and always to bear in mind those fundamental  moral distinctions between systems of government that believe in the dignity of the individual and other systems that simply see the individual as a cog in the great machine of the state.

nonapplause As I said in my TV address yesterday: Our agenda is quite simple -- to appoint judges who don't confuse the criminals with the victims and who believe the courts should interpret the law  not make it.
nonapplause Well  if enough of you make your voices heard  we can restore the right of voluntary prayer in the classroom.

nonapplause The new frontier of population holds out great promise for this country and also critical problems.
nonapplause Now  with this great reception that you've given me  I have to say that there was once upon a time that to be a Republican in this area of the country felt a little bit like being Gary Cooper in "High Noon" --   -- outnumbered in a big way.
nonapplause Isn't that marvellous  you and Hazel  absolutely terrific!
nonapplause And I know I speak for Senator Hawkins when I say thanks for all that you've done.
nonapplause You know why?
nonapplause I don't remember talking about 401s when I was growing up  or IRAs  but there's a whole investor society.

nonapplause I'm so proud of you.
nonapplause And I'm going to lead the Congress in a way that provides the help and stimulus necessary for there to be economic growth.
nonapplause I had a great uncle one time who just died at 91 who had about a 4th grade education.
nonapplause And that's why my administration has already taken aggressive action on their behalf.
nonapplause That's the status quo.
nonapplause I think the issues that we're addressing are as important as any that I can recall during the course of my political career.
nonapplause As our cooperation grows closer  so do our people.
nonapplause He never stopped fighting.
nonapplause And now I want to tell you why it's important.
nonapplause We care about those who have returned with injuries  and we have a responsibility to help them on the hard road ahead.
nonapplause After all  the money we spend in Washington is not the government's money -- it's the people's money.
nonapplause Right now there are food deserts in every single state in this country  so we've set an ambitious goal  and that is to eliminate every last one of those food deserts within seven years.
nonapplause Now  I know that lately there's been a nice game of saying  "Well  the tack today is to blame those over the last 20 years that caused these things  and we don't take any blame for anything."
nonapplause That leads me to the fourth  and the cruelest  myth -- and that is the false hope that we can abandon the effort in Iraq without serious consequences to our interests in the broader Middle East.
nonapplause That would literally open community college to virtually everyone in America.
nonapplause And those elections will be held in about 10 days  on October 9th.
nonapplause It's a procedure.
nonapplause In fact  the September figures released last week show an $800-million drop in imports and an $800-million increase in exports.
nonapplause Rushmore.
nonapplause But that's not all.
nonapplause And there's no question in my mind that when you put your mind to it  you can.
nonapplause And I said  you know  Texas has changed  Houston has changed  America has changed.
nonapplause Basically  it was the idea that we would stop making false choices in Washington and try to unify our country.
nonapplause This cooperation will help the people of India produce more of their energy from clean  safe nuclear power  and that  in turn  will help their economy grow.
nonapplause And peace can only come by drawing the moderate Arab nations into the peacemaking process  along with Egypt and Israel  who are already hard at work at that.
nonapplause I must say that during those very meetings in London at the end of November and earlier this week the political heads of our Member States were very much aware of our increased need for cohesion.
nonapplause Mmm  yes.
nonapplause Keep in mind -- you all know this and we have to explain this to the citizens and the parents -- these tests are not graded on the curve.
nonapplause I visited a Chrysler plant in Detroit a few weeks back  and this was a plant that would have shut down had we not moved forward.
nonapplause There are many other areas  but just let me say that I have had a strong conviction for many years  and I spoke of the matter in the case of Indochina and later in Algeria  that the greatest asset we have is the desire of all these people to be free and independent.
nonapplause The Comfort's history is an important part of this nation's story.
nonapplause That is the most difficult of all assignments.
nonapplause If we are to protect the American people and defend civilization against determined enemies  we cannot always rely on the old Cold War remedies of containment and deterrence.
nonapplause It starts with Senators Kerry and Edwards voting yes when the President asked the Congress to authorize the use of force against Saddam Hussein.
nonapplause But as the Sun rises tomorrow  a great new chapter for America will begin when we elect George Bush.
nonapplause We had hoped that our opponents would join us and make this a bipartisan effort because  as the program stands now  there is a long-term collapse of the program simply on the basis of the actuarial imbalance that exists within it.
nonapplause They punished the poor and the young who struggled as prices of necessity shot up faster than others.
nonapplause And we did pretty well in Connecticut last night.
nonapplause For too long -- for too long  opportunistic politicians have created an all-or-nothing system -- your group is either in or you're out  and the resources of the state were treated as spoils for the winner  rather than the rightful birthright of the people of Kenya.
nonapplause During the course of this campaign  we have seen something quite different in the President's opponent.
nonapplause The basic math is that 32 million people wouldn't get a break under his plan  and 27 million wouldn't get a break under the Bush plan.
nonapplause And they organized this to demonstrate that they were going to try to do something.
nonapplause He predicted that independence would be celebrated “from one end of the continent to the other  from this time forward forever.” But he added  “I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this declaration and support and defend these states.”
nonapplause Now  in this election we've had a tough time.
nonapplause And so it should be.
nonapplause Now I know that there are those who suggest that the way to get greater production in America is for the Federal Government to move in with massive spending programs here  there  and everywhere else.
nonapplause But the most impressive thing about Tom goes beyond his accomplishments as an elected official.
nonapplause May I make it absolutely clear that Britain is fully communautaire and that in many cases she is leading the pack and will continue to lead the pack in facing the real problems.
nonapplause Now  the issue before the American people is  some say  whether we should change.
nonapplause More than 38 000 Iraqis have been hired as police officers.
nonapplause The high-end option would be some 1 900 generating plants over that same 20-year period of time.
nonapplause We're going to work Pakistan and Afghanistan to enhance cooperation to defeat what I would call a common enemy.
nonapplause NAEP is not new.
nonapplause And when we do  America will be a much better place.
nonapplause So how can they now argue that the authorization for the use of military force somehow implicitly authorized it all along?
nonapplause No one else believes this  but I'm always -- but I would remind you  for all of the fights we've had  we have this year passed a very tough antiterrorism bill  we've passed a telecommunications bill that I believe will create hundreds of thousands of high-wage jobs in America within the very near future by getting both the benefits of more competition and the requirement to adequately serve schools and hospitals and places in rural America as well as urban America -- all that's in that telecom bill that we passed.
nonapplause They really wanted to be here.
nonapplause And lo and behold  it worked.
nonapplause And I was praying that  somehow  we might be able to recover  in the spirit of the leaders and the people  what was felt then in that happy moment.
nonapplause And while we're talking about Jim's record  one of the accomplishments of which Jim is most proud is an issue of great concern to Nevadans.
nonapplause That's what Wendy told me.
nonapplause Our work there continues.
nonapplause We'll win this struggle for peace.
nonapplause You know it here in Florida  and particularly here because you're on the cutting edge of so many of those changes.
nonapplause "The Challenge of a New Age."
nonapplause From the very night of September 11th  when George and I were reunited at the White House  I've seen his character and his courage lead his efforts.
nonapplause Still as the new century dawns  the world is filled with the promise and hope that we can overcome ancient hatreds to build a modern peace for our children.

nonapplause Why had no one noticed him there for the last 5 000 years?
nonapplause He said  I want to make my boy free.
nonapplause And it is to that objective that I pledge the next administration as well.
nonapplause Here's the reason it's all right.
nonapplause You know  every NGO just about  with an environmental or a labor ax to grind is going to be outside the meeting room in Seattle  demonstrating against us  telling us what a terrible thing world trade is.
nonapplause I applaud them for taking this important step  and I predict it will have very beneficial consequences.
nonapplause As a result  we spend more money than anybody else and cover fewer people  and charge more for the premiums to the people who are paying because we have to pay for the emergency costs that hospitals and doctors have to absorb when the people without insurance show up.
nonapplause Thereafter  United States forces withdrew from Somalia.
nonapplause Billy volunteers at the Fort Campbell YMCA.
nonapplause And now  only about 1 in 7 or 8 early retirees have any carryover health insurance from their employer.

nonapplause Stevens is a little country town full of people who go to church every Sunday and sing songs like you just heard.

nonapplause First of all  the $400 hammer: We'd bought 22 000 hammers for between $6.75 and $7.50  and this one hammer was in an invoice submitted to the Navy with a whole list of things.
nonapplause That's not the way it works.
nonapplause Why did he do it?
nonapplause What we need to do is set priorities and always remember whose money we're talking about.
nonapplause We in the United States  above all  must remember that lesson  for we were founded as a nation of openness to people of all beliefs.

nonapplause And the City has been among the first to lend a hand in helping and advising young people on how to get started.
nonapplause And our philosophy  the philosophy of the bill that I'm going to submit to the Congress incorporates that greatness of America in its core.
nonapplause No raise or promotion will ever top the joy of hugging a child after work.
nonapplause We're doing a little better than that; we're doing a lot better.
nonapplause Now  at first glance  this might look good.
nonapplause And also remember  failing to reform our health care system in a way that genuinely reduces cost growth will cost us trillions of dollars more in lost economic growth and lower wages.
nonapplause We must examine our problems  decide upon the solutions  and then forcefully and without hesitation take action.
nonapplause Now  that's a lot  but get this: It would take 13 million of those images to map the entire sky.
nonapplause We've got to invest in education.
nonapplause The problem is  if you talk to the police officers of the country  if you talk to the prosecutors and the former prosecutors  like the Mayor  they will tell you that this is like all of our other problems -- if we will all take some responsibility for it  we can make progress.
nonapplause We were going to take it higher  and we reached agreement on that.
nonapplause The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people.
nonapplause I have been surprised  as I have told those who have traveled with us through the outer islands today and yesterday - I have been surprised at the magnificent work that has been done by the Republican organization in arranging our meetings.
nonapplause We need the talent  the energy  the skills of every man and woman  every boy and girl in this country.
nonapplause Yet Betty Jean Spencer and Vince and Roberta Roper can't ignore the brutality of drugs.

nonapplause When American politics works best  it's when it reflects the lives of the American people.

nonapplause But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land: locked factory gates  long gasoline lines  intolerable prices  and interest rates turning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams.

nonapplause The conscience of America was outraged by the ambush of Medgar Evers  by kidnappings and terror bombings  and by the murder of four young girls in a church on a Sunday.
nonapplause That's really why I'm here.
nonapplause And it has something to do with the fact that we did the right things.

nonapplause Italians and Americans do not forget that the liberty we cherish has come at a cost.
nonapplause He's expanding health care options  health insurance options for Americans  promoting new ideas like health savings accounts.
nonapplause And the environmental difficulties and challenges have slowed that effort  and I thank all the representatives from the Defense Department here for their commitment to this endeavor because it will have a major impact on both the environment and our ability to spark economic opportunity in communities throughout the nation.
nonapplause And they are doing it at the state level; they are doing it at the federal level; they are doing it at every level.
nonapplause And we are working on that.
nonapplause I don't know how many of you earlier this morning might have had an opportunity to watch on television as some citizens were being interviewed who publicly have stated they are simply going to rebel at paying their income tax  and they're going to appeal to others to do the same.
nonapplause And I'm very grateful for that.
nonapplause Same to the Governor of this great state  our close friend  Tom Ridge  and his wife  Michelle.
nonapplause Young people couldn't buy homes  car loans were hard to get and expensive  the auto and the homebuilding industries were brought to their knees.
nonapplause That's what this election is about -- moving forward.
nonapplause One of the things we have got to do is to show these young people who are dropping out of the system  who aren't voting  who feel cynical about it  that they can have a positive future if they won't give up on themselves after high school and they'll put themselves in a position where they can get skills and they can continue to learn for a lifetime.

nonapplause The kind of strategy that we used vis-a-vis the Soviet Union during the Cold War  where we held at risk the things that they valued in order to deter them from ever launching an attack against the United States  simply doesn't work where terrorists are concerned.

nonapplause Let me just make one final comment.
nonapplause The media tends to play up every hint of conflict  because it makes for a sexier story -– which means anyone interested in getting coverage feels compelled to make their arguments as outrageous and as incendiary as possible.
nonapplause That's the ultimate threat we're faced with these days  and we have to think about that when we begin to devise a strategy and a policy and a set of institutions that we want to pursue going forward to protect against that kind of an attack  and to guarantee the safety and security of the American people well into the future.

nonapplause And I think we've got some great letters  good healthy snacks  a Bo baseball card  which --   --
nonapplause And that's why I came here today -- because I need your help and your support  because now we've come through all these years of this remarkable economic expansion  we have finally seen even income inequality begin to diminish over the last two and a half years  as more and more Americans at the lower end of the income scale begin to fully participate in the economy.
nonapplause We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids.
nonapplause New businesses are springing up—Making and selling goods which hadn't even been invented eight years ago.

nonapplause It was 50 years ago that a young candidate for president came here to Michigan and delivered a speech that inspired one of the most successful service projects in American history.
nonapplause That means if you were to invest a dollar in the market in '83  it would be worth $11 today  while your dollar in Social Security is worth $3.
nonapplause And -- but the $2 trillion is all that's retiring over the next 10 years -- all that's to be retired over the next 10 years.

nonapplause In the literal sense of the words  "the two become one flesh."

nonapplause There are lots of things to be done here.
nonapplause And then we have these wonderful folks who will keep coming along and telling us  "Well  you can't legislate morality."

nonapplause The Aceh Peace Accord is a hopeful step toward the vision of Indonesia whole  free and at peace.

nonapplause And policemen and fire fighters and people who wear our nation's uniform are reminding us what it means to sacrifice for something greater than yourself.
nonapplause It means an awful lot.
nonapplause But the point I'm making is  you need to go out across the state  across the community  across the country  to your friends and say  whether you agree with me or not  this is an important election.
nonapplause And whatever you have paid into the system  if you're unfortunate enough to pass on  about the time you hit retirement age  you'd have paid in your entire career and you get nothing back -- nothing you can leave your kids  there's no survivable assets  if you will  there's no ownership of an asset the way there would be with respect to our personal retirement accounts.
nonapplause So if you have less time for leisure  if you're not sure you can even afford a vacation  much less send your kids to college  and you keep reading how great the statistics are  and all the rest of your information you get from some more negative source  it's not hard to understand how people are a little disoriented.

nonapplause How can we turn away from them?
nonapplause One is Harry Byrd  who served this State so ably for so many years  and the other one is the current leader of the Republican Party -- me.
nonapplause Faith in a better life over the horizon.
nonapplause Let me begin by thanking Chairman Don Fowler.
nonapplause And in some fundamental way  I would somehow belong to her for the rest of my life.
nonapplause Then there are the entitlements for those in need  or entitlements that are in a special category because you can't predict how much is going to be needed every year.
nonapplause Sooner or later  within a few years -- keep in mind  every year that goes by the problem is only going to get tougher  it's not going to get easier  because you have less time to fix a big problem -- then sooner or later we'll be forced with the choice of either saying  well  I'm sorry  we can't do this so we're just going to have to cut benefits 22 percent  in which case a lot of seniors will be in deep trouble.
nonapplause The economic recovery program will prove as successful as the oil decontrol decision.
nonapplause I reject it because of what I've seen here at MIT.

nonapplause I just want to say two serious things about the future tonight.
nonapplause After all  I was given the most fortunate of lives.
nonapplause Labour's failure to cope  to look at the nation's problems from the point of view of the whole nation  not just one section of it  has led to loss of confidence and a sense of helplessness.
nonapplause And your support for this is going to make a huge difference in helping us get this done.
nonapplause I spoke as it involves all of Africa  Latin America and Asia.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause And clearly they inspired successive generations of heroes -- men and women who fought in Korea  Vietnam and the Persian Gulf; who steadily won the Cold War; who served with such skill and compassion in Haiti; who saved so many lives in more than one place in Africa; who halted the Bosnia Serb attacks against innocent civilians.
nonapplause And that's why I ask you to make your decision in that spirit.
nonapplause The economic recovery which is now under way needs the spirited participation of individuals.
nonapplause Just as after the Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the depression  so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rules that punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novel concept --   ; rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home  get a credit card or invest in a 401(k).
nonapplause And I say all this as someone who grew up without a father in my own life.
nonapplause We don't have to put up with streets where our kids can't walk safely.
nonapplause The rising crime and violence in the street  the children killing children  the mothers destroying their babies--but now  something I believe even worse  in fact  than the acts themselves.
nonapplause But we have more to do.
nonapplause It would be an I.O.U.
nonapplause Tell the Congress to give democracy a chance  and I promise you we'll get rid of the pork-barrel spending that slips through every year.
nonapplause And we have a responsibility to write and enforce these rules to protect consumers of financial products  to protect taxpayers  and to protect our economy as a whole.
nonapplause In other words  we need to up our game.
nonapplause The Afghan military is a respected institution  committed to its duties  and critical to the success of this nation.
nonapplause And it's amazing; it's like any other kind of job  it actually yields to effort.
nonapplause We are working to keep Iraq in check so that it does not threaten the rest of the world or its region with weapons of mass destruction.
nonapplause I have no doubt that Jeff is ready to take it on.
nonapplause We are all depending on you.
nonapplause I urge all of you to look at the guide and use it here in Pennsylvania  in each of your neighborhoods.
nonapplause And every one of us must summon that spirit of unity  to embrace those things that bind us together  and never to succumb to those things that would keep us apart.
nonapplause Because the Hutus and the Tutsis think the most important thing about them is they're not the other guy.
nonapplause And as we go forward  I pledge to protect and preserve the resources for our diplomacy that Warren Christopher has put to such good use.
nonapplause The volunteers were near the end of their rope  and thousands of enlistments were set to expire on New Year's Day.
nonapplause We wish to be partners with you in the common struggles of the 21st century.
nonapplause Those terrorists who remain at large are determined to use these capabilities against the United States and our friends and allies around the world.
nonapplause I think we had one right at the end of World War II  after we'd won that tremendous victory against the Germans and the Japanese  and then all of a sudden we were faced with the prospect of the Cold War  and the Soviet Union  and the threat that that represented to the United States.
nonapplause The United States is working with governments and private organizations throughout Africa to achieve this goal.
nonapplause But after visiting for just a day  I will leave with a renewed sense of hope and optimism because of the will of the Haitian people and the steadfast commitment of those of you standing here today and the international community you represent.
nonapplause We know that because we found evidence that they had been trying to acquire that kind of capability in the caves and training camps in Afghanistan.
nonapplause You go to letsmove.gov  but you'll get all that information.
nonapplause Each of your shops and firms reflects different passions  and different ideas  and different skills.
nonapplause He was a farmer  a teacher  a circuit judge and a war hero.
nonapplause Although we've been in the struggle against terrorism for nearly five years now  the terrorists were actually at war with us long before 2001.
nonapplause Education is important for its own sake.
nonapplause Without getting into the legal intricacies  it faces a number of embarrassing facts.
nonapplause And I thank the American people  and especially those here represented  for making this day happen.
nonapplause Take any field of endeavor -- any achievement of this country -- and Italian-Americans are part of it.
nonapplause Because -- I have no objection  by the way  to the political debate  and I have encouraged the people of faith who come to different political conclusions than I have to be a part of the debate.
nonapplause He was the man who buried that ice axe mountaineers  mountain climbers carry in the head of Leon Trotsky.
nonapplause Every day  as much as we hate to admit it  there are people in America who get up hungry and who go to bed hungry.
nonapplause And you're working with other groups in the industry to meet the goal of doubling the amount of produce used in the food industry over the next 10 years.
nonapplause We're proud of them  we're proud of what they accomplished.
nonapplause But I hope you will listen to what I have to say; and I know that you have friends not only all over this state  but all over this country  and I hope you will share it with them.
nonapplause We have the largest number of children in our schools in history  the first time more people than the baby boom -- and  by far  more diverse.
nonapplause High taxes and runaway regulations had driven our economy to its knees with a 1 - 2 - 3 combination of inflation  economic stagnation  and unemployment.
nonapplause In two-and-a-half years  we've done a lot.
nonapplause I grew up as a child here living on the stories of how the GIs came home from World War II and took over the city government and the county government and cleaned it up and moved it forward.
nonapplause Are we going to keep the prosperity going and build on the changes in the last eight years that are working  or are we going to reverse course?
nonapplause See?
nonapplause Unless we can match it  unless we can be superior to it in the next decade  the balance of power will shift against us  and once we are isolated  what chance of security and what chance of peace.
nonapplause Interest rates stay down  investments stay high  more jobs are created; with inflation low  more money for wage increases.
nonapplause In the time when the liberals and the socialists and the Democrats had their time in the limelight  what did they do?
nonapplause And in the next week  they'll need more of your energy and enthusiasm.
nonapplause It's the people's money.
nonapplause The Alliance has carried its strength not as a battle flag  but as a banner of peace.
nonapplause So now it is also my privilege to present a distinguished American with an award in recognition of the many contributions of naturalized citizens like all of you.
nonapplause But what I want to tell you is  we are going in the right direction  and we can keep going in the right direction if we remember to keep our eyes on those things which really matter  and if we do not become diverted.
nonapplause Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured  who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy.
nonapplause I did  because Presidents aren't allowed to talk like generals talk.
nonapplause ﻿  Transcript of Remarks of the Vice President  Hayward Shopping Center  Hayward  Calif.
nonapplause It's getting people all stressed out.
nonapplause We can pursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the wider world.
nonapplause And it's a future in which our economy is powered not by what we borrow and spend but what we invent and what we build.
nonapplause We are proud that Sweden is one of five countries singled out to be honored there for having had diplomatic relations with the United States for more than 200 years.
nonapplause The reason I'm here is because I work like crazy to turn this country around  to make sure people believed America could work  just so we would be in this position  and it would be an era of colossal proportions.
nonapplause This year  when it served his purpose  he described himself as an opponent of the war.
nonapplause Perhaps no one had the clout to get the job done.
nonapplause And together  you'll be helping students learn where food comes from  and develop healthy habits.
nonapplause And what were the results of this -- 3.8 million new jobs  one-and-a-half percent drop in the unemployment rate  the largest number of new business starts last year of any year since World War II with no inflation.
nonapplause In fact  many states are already exercising their review authority.
nonapplause Inflation was ripping our country apart.
nonapplause To garden.
nonapplause And we're going to need every one of you to buckle up and work even harder.
nonapplause Well I hope presumably there have been other attempts to modernise the place since then  but basically we have a very strong tradition there and one can find the mark of time and one has to be sensitive to the mark of time.
nonapplause This is part of it  and ironically  we will be one of the greatest beneficiaries by doing what is right for Chin a and for the rest of the world.
nonapplause It's critical that as our country emerges from this period of crisis  that we learn its lessons; that those who seek reward do not take reckless risk; that short-term gains are not pursued without regard for long-term consequences.
nonapplause But none of it would have been possible without you.
nonapplause Thank you very much  Governor.
nonapplause But let me give you a sample from the Internal Revenue Code.
nonapplause So let there be no doubt: The future belongs to the nation that best educates its citizens -- and my fellow Americans  we have everything we need to be that nation.
nonapplause And they desperately want to provide the very best service for the American people.
nonapplause And it is a global problem.
nonapplause It was the American Dream.
nonapplause Last spring in your report  you documented 20 years of decline  20 years of declining academic standards and declining discipline.
nonapplause I look to the future of the United States with optimism.
nonapplause But over a billion people in this old world live on less than $2 a day.
nonapplause And the way that we as Republicans  as common sense conservatives  look at welfare reform: it's not how many people are on welfare  but rather how many people are leading independent  self-reliant lives with families intact.
nonapplause All of you come from hardy  risk-taking stock  and you're very much the sort of people who would  in a few years  take the few thousand you'd gain from a tax cut and pool it with friends and acquaintances in order to invest it.
nonapplause I appreciate my friend  Mercer Reynolds  joining us  too  as well.
nonapplause For President and Mrs. Bush  love of country and service to it have always meant the same thing.
nonapplause Well  could I give you just a little lesson in civics and politics?
nonapplause We have to make sure that we are supporting promising reforms like charter schools and other initiatives underway in many of your districts.
nonapplause Household net worth is at an all-time high.
nonapplause We can raise cattle and use the hides  the leather  and the wool to clothe our people.
nonapplause And I am looking forward to continuing to see the great work that you guys do in the years to come.
nonapplause And I come as a mother  thinking about what my daughters  and what all of our sons and daughters  can learn from the 40 men and women whose memories we honor today.
nonapplause And I believe  and I know Senator Feinstein believes  that we ought to ask handgun owners to have a license  the way we ask drivers to do.
nonapplause She said  “We had nothing before the hurricane.
nonapplause And possibly that explains the paradox of calling the day "graduation" at the same time that we call it "commencement."
nonapplause We must be concerned about the perception children of every race are developing about themselves and about others.
nonapplause It is true that we have seen over the last two years a rash of high-profile shootings  often with children as both the victims and the perpetrators.
nonapplause I didn't just discover the merits of biofuels like ethanol when I first hopped on the campaign bus.
nonapplause But the Bible  the one book with which you may not be familiar  warns us against those of whom it may be said  "The words of his mouth were as smooth as butter  but war was in his heart."
nonapplause Everybody knows that.
nonapplause And let me give you an example of why we've had a hard time understanding what the potential of the economy is.
nonapplause Now  I know this veto is going to be overridden.
nonapplause I am proud of you for being willing to help carry on this debate.
nonapplause You had very very tough commentators and they showed you up if you ran away from the question.
nonapplause We know the Brady background check law has kept half a million felons  fugitives and stalkers from getting guns and I think that we ought to close the loophole that allows a lot of people to buy at these gun shows and not do the background checks.
nonapplause After all  what issues do they have to run on?
nonapplause We kept the loan volume the same to white males and dramatically increased it to females and minorities and never changed the standards.
nonapplause I would argue you don't need a big bureaucratic top-down government in the way we needed in the industrial era.
nonapplause That's what prompted President Roosevelt to launch the Social Security system in 1935  to create what he called the cornerstone of a civilized society.
nonapplause We worked hard to fight the terrorists.
nonapplause After we're done here  they'll be holding a clinic as part of Michelle's “Let's Move!” initiative to help our young people live healthy and active lives.
nonapplause There's more about him.
nonapplause Yesterday  I assembled this cabinet for an update on our efforts so far.
nonapplause But if you're Bill Gates  that means you're only paying payroll tax on 1/10th of 1 percent of what you earn  because you earn so much more -- $100 000  that's just the first fraction of what you earn  and then you stop paying it.
nonapplause Yes  we can!
nonapplause It's about creating a culture where  as Martha Johnson puts it  “Work is what you do  not where you are.”
nonapplause Choice  high standards  better teachers—a wider horizon for every child from every background.
nonapplause And this isn't their only area where that's true.
nonapplause But you know what I mean.
nonapplause In all of these and other ways  1960 and 1928 may be sisters under the skin.
nonapplause Wow.
nonapplause Now  I have kept in touch with that woman for 10 years  and she introduced me the day I signed the welfare reform bill.
nonapplause We must continue cracking down on crime.
nonapplause But as I heard those personal stories before I came out here  I couldn't help thinking how similar they were to a story about drugs in the workplace that I was planning to tell you.
nonapplause In Northern Ireland they play an even more vital role than in Great Britain.
nonapplause And that's what we're working hard to do.
nonapplause He's telling us about the destruction of our capacity to defend the people and interests of the United States  and then he punctuates it with a smile!
nonapplause By the time we took office  the economy was sliding into recession.
nonapplause And if we're honest  another part of the reason has been the fierce opposition fueled by some interest groups and lobbyists -- opposition that has used fear tactics to paint any effort to achieve reform as an attempt to  yes  socialize medicine.
nonapplause I mean  the time I was a little kid  I've worked in a grocery store.
nonapplause The most promising economic forum we have for debating a lot of these issues in the new Pacific community is the Organization for Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC.
nonapplause It has been a long  hard battle.
nonapplause Now let me remind you  civilized societies with writing arose here in the Middle East a little over 6 000 years ago and we have only had the prospect of building a global community  modeled on the kind of activity you see all around you here in Dubai  for 13 years.
nonapplause Now we've learned a new ethic  and it had to do with Flight 93.
nonapplause Last week  for example  the WTO ruled in favor of the United States on a case that found European governments were subsidizing planes that Airbus manufactures.
nonapplause As they said in the film "Back to the Future " "Where we're going  we don't need roads."
nonapplause ﻿  speech in Springfield
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause So  the whole 6 months looks pretty good.
nonapplause So we're working together  we're moving forward.
nonapplause We are greatly honored today to be joined by two leaders who clearly understand this.
nonapplause Now  in this budget fight  there are those who believe that they should get rid of this earned income tax credit  or cut it in half  or cut it by a third.
nonapplause The progress that we've enjoyed has not been  as our liberal opposition would like the public to believe  as a result of luck or personality or the celestial effects of Halley's Comet.
nonapplause We live in a moment of hope.
nonapplause By acting in Afghanistan and Iraq  we demonstrated both our strength and our resolve.
nonapplause Every once in a while I see some signs about nuclear freeze  and I know my opponent has talked of this -- nuclear freeze.
nonapplause One of the ways you can step up is by helping us today as the buckets again come through.
nonapplause Soaking the rich soon turned out to be soaking everybody who worked for a living.
nonapplause The campaign season will come in due course  and when it does  President Bush and I will run hard  and we'll take nothing for granted.
nonapplause Interdependence can be good or bad.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause When compared to students in other industrialized nations  we've begun to realize that many of ours place badly.
nonapplause I recognize that this is a very controversial process and that there are sincere differences of opinion about certain provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.
nonapplause Better still  almost all students said it was wrong even to try a drug like cocaine.
nonapplause It raises the maximum family income level to include hundreds of thousands of families who did not qualify for Pell Grants before.
nonapplause And I don't think my opponent will mention it in this campaign  possibly because it was over 20 when he left the Vice Presidency  and it's now down to 11.6.
nonapplause Now  I've also heard that you who are students here care about your community  and that in one of your most popular clubs you visit hospitals and help the sick and those with handicaps  as well as giving of yourselves in many other services to your community.
nonapplause Praise God.
nonapplause You fought beside our allies in cold and rugged terrain  against trained and resourceful killers.
nonapplause There are 31 million American children who participate in the federal school lunch program; 11 million are part of the school breakfast program.
nonapplause Whenever I speak to students  she asks me to remind you: For your families  for your friends  and just for yourselves  just say no to drugs and alcohol.
nonapplause But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they'll be met.
nonapplause No one should be forced to take a bus trip to Canada to get medicines made in the U.S. at a lower price.
nonapplause Proposals in the field of health  in the field of education which will see to it that we give more and more of our young people the opportunity to develop their potentialities to the full.
nonapplause You are required to finish the job.
nonapplause This conference couldn't have happened 8 years ago -- not enough people cared.
nonapplause The Massachusetts equivalent of the Supreme Court of the state--they have a case number for them  and they decide--after  sort of  undue consideration--that the marriage laws of the state are wrong  and that you must allow people of the same sex to get married.
nonapplause You know  when Roy was doing that riff  you know  before he came I didn't know I needed new furniture  I didn't know I needed new art work  I didn't know I needed -- Mary kept getting redder and redder  and finally she says  he may not know he needs another place to spend the night tonight.
nonapplause And today we'll hear the case for doing more along those lines  I suspect as well.
nonapplause We do need to cut spending further.
nonapplause So we think in this election we've got the best ticket.
nonapplause That one bullet not only pierced that soldier's skull  but pierced America's consciousness as well.
nonapplause It's important  because we've got unfunded liabilities out there that can serve as a drag on our economy  and we've got a young generation of Americans coming up that are going to be contributing to a system that's broke.
nonapplause They have left us the task of providing the buildings  which we are doing now  for raising the school-leaving age.
nonapplause But this is a very dynamic time and the worst thing we could do is to be complacent.
nonapplause Our enemies  the terrorists and their supporters  offer a narrow and backward vision.
nonapplause And on the other side  we're going to have Senator Kennedy  who thinks that we're too weak on health care.
nonapplause Last fall  more than 1 000 American troops participated in Juniper Cobra ballistic missile defense exercises  the largest such drill to date.
nonapplause The argument is that the more complex societies grow  and the more interconnected we all get  the more interdependent we become  the more we have to look for nonzero sum solutions.
nonapplause And I think the world is about to learn that once we Americans put our minds to it and are provided the proper tools and equipment  we can outproduce  outsell  and outcompete anybody  anywhere in the world.
nonapplause All of these measures failed.
nonapplause It is obvious that every single one of us who care about this is going to have to work even harder to educate our children about the dangers drugs pose.
nonapplause We can be out of debt in 15 years  for the first time since 1835.
nonapplause It is essential that the Community establish contingency plans and programmes to produce effective joint action.
nonapplause I also want you to know  ladies and gentlemen  that I was in Iraq yesterday  and spent some time with soldiers  Marines  and Navy corpsmen serving in the western part of the country.
nonapplause They're one fine group of young men and women.
nonapplause Thank you very much for your welcome and may I thank all of those who have participated in this program for their very kind words and for the work they have done in arranging this meeting today.
nonapplause And there are people from other parts of the nation here who don't really realize necessarily -- because they might not have been here before -- that anybody who surfs the Net and goes to a home page on the World Wide Web owes a debt of gratitude to this university and this campus for the creation of mosaic that made the World Wide Web accessible all around the country.
nonapplause Now  why would they do that?
nonapplause Last quarter the gross national product grew at a healthy 4.3-percent rate.
nonapplause And if you're Christians  you've heard it at weddings a hundred times.
nonapplause All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about.
nonapplause And the reason we have it is because of the men and women in uniform  in every branch of service  who make so many sacrifices  and their families make those sacrifices alongside them.
nonapplause Fort Carson is also a post where the families of the deployed soldiers are cared for by some great Family Support Groups.
nonapplause We have done so much  but believe me  maybe it's just because I've just got three years and a few months left  but I think all the time about 2010 and 2015 and 2020 and what this country is going to be like when my child is my age.
nonapplause It's not like we're unacquainted with the issues.
nonapplause So there are just so many ways to get involved.
nonapplause It could be the key to victory for everything we believe in.
nonapplause They will be discussed later.
nonapplause And do they have the capacity to implement their commitments?
nonapplause Let's keep America moving forward.
nonapplause Okay?
nonapplause But the reason all of us are here  companies large and small  is to talk about an issue with far-reaching consequences for our economy in the long run  and that's the education of our children.
nonapplause So I'm especially happy to be here tonight.
nonapplause Technology can be a great liberation for children  particularly in poorer neighborhoods; and  if properly used  for children that are having learning problems; and  if properly used  children who need to become fully fluent in English as well as whatever their native tongue is.
nonapplause Because the Florida constitution  unlike some of our constitutions  doesn't leave things to be implied.
nonapplause And the same reason you do a lot of the things that you do.
nonapplause Vice President Bush was warmly received in Europe  where he helped clear up many misconceptions about American policy.
nonapplause Here is a man who will use any means to do that - to conquer the world.
nonapplause If America's cities can go into the 21st century flourishing  then America will do very well.
nonapplause That's the spirit that we celebrated in the Olympics and we need to make American life more that way.
nonapplause And it is for this reason that I would like to ask each and every one of you sitting in this room – students  educators and policymakers – to follow the honorable path that President Clinton has chosen so many times and to stand up and fight against the ongoing genocide in Darfur.
nonapplause But for four years  after living together for decades  people set upon each other and slaughtered each other and even killed children  ravaged families.
nonapplause He was really good.
nonapplause That is one service that we should all be happy to carry out for Mr Callaghan.
nonapplause That's a good thing.
nonapplause The United States made our position clear: We could not accept the grave danger of Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies turning weapons of mass destruction against us or our friends and allies.
nonapplause Well  it's true that in American politics  some of us may prefer different paths from time to time  but we're all heading toward the same goal.
nonapplause One of the interesting consequences of the recovery of our administration  the economic recovery we sparked  is we've given all those Republicans a lot more money to spend on politics.
nonapplause And they are the foundation of a close and warm friendship between our two nations.
nonapplause Why was the rising tide not lifting all boats?
nonapplause And do you know something?
nonapplause He's managed our environmental programs  including our partnership for a new generation of vehicles.
nonapplause Out of the devastation of Katrina will come great opportunities to get a fresh start in life.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause And mine will be next Tuesday with my opponent  John Edwards.
nonapplause The rest of us need that.
nonapplause I remember the news accounts said of the crowd: "They rose and cheered  filling the old arena with an emotional ovation that brought tears to many."
nonapplause I have fought to make sure that every American child has access to the technological wonders that are remaking our world.
nonapplause I have no doubt that the American people  with God's help  are up to the challenge.
nonapplause And tonight  as this new election season opens  I intend to rejoin the national debate.
nonapplause .
nonapplause Our opponents have a very different vision for the country.
nonapplause The food packages would not total a cost of $3.25 a month for the Government - one can of dried eggs  some powdered milk  some rice  some grain  and this summer the Department of Agriculture announced it is going to add lard.
nonapplause Their wonderful families that you have applauded so warmly today are perhaps the best and finest testament to the lives that they lived.
nonapplause And what I want to say  I had to be here tonight  too.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause It's hard to think of any category of information that could be more important to the safety of the United States.
nonapplause It says something important about a man that can walk these corridors for 16 years and leave behind not a trace of ill will.
nonapplause If you're from a big state like California  say  or Texas  and you've got 30 or 40 colleagues to work on state issues with  the world looks a little different than if you're the only member from Wyoming.
nonapplause I know the politicians don't talk about this much.
nonapplause The United States of America was never meant to be a second-best nation.
nonapplause And that's a particularly difficult problem in a world where the challenges America faces are often quite complex and require rigorous sustained disciplined analysis.
nonapplause From duty at sea we welcome the men and women of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit.
nonapplause I am grateful for your trust in us."
nonapplause And it's obvious why more and more people are covered by managed care.
nonapplause But here  too  the Soviets have made things very difficult.
nonapplause And now  as enemies continue to plan attacks against the United States  your fellow citizens are counting on you to help protect and secure our homeland.
nonapplause He understands that freedom is among the greatest of all blessings and that freedom is a gift of God.
nonapplause I think I've learned in the last 5 months how important it is that we  as Republicans  continue to work together as a team to accomplish our objective.
nonapplause Now a fall in unemployment is what everyone wants  and no-one more that I.
nonapplause They drove to another location and raped her again.
nonapplause And Mr. President and distinguished guests  this is  as you have already heard  truly an historic occasion  because it will touch the lives of every American today and for generations to come.
nonapplause Yeats once said  “In dreams begin responsibility.” Well  ladies and gentlemen  the dreams that President Obama has awakened and have awakened in the American people are generating a new sense of responsibility that I think is going to serve this nation well.
nonapplause I've even seen I've got some fraternity brothers in the crowd.
nonapplause He still averages -- listen to this -- 275 performances a year.
nonapplause And so that's why Hillary's opponent can raise a double ton of money besides being mayor and having special relations with a lot of those people that --   -- New York.
nonapplause And as is often the case  I'll look at him and ask him if he had said his prayers  and what he asked for.
nonapplause The economy is changing.
nonapplause We faced another problem.
nonapplause There are just too many kids that are living a life off of high-calorie food and they're not getting enough exercise.
nonapplause And I'm asking Congress to establish a foundation that will leverage the energy  creativity and resources of the private sector in furthering the mission of the President's Council on Physical Fitness  to help every young person in America to live an active  safe and healthy life.
nonapplause It has decreased 40 percent in the last half century.
nonapplause And now he is on the line at Chrysler.
nonapplause That is what the threat of Thatcherism means  and I am only too glad that the British people will take the opportunity at the next election to make sure that I and the other Members will not have to sit through a third session of Mrs Thatcher reporting as the President of the Council.
nonapplause One year ago we liberated Grenada from Communist thugs who had taken over that country.
nonapplause We get all caught up in very important local races  statewide races and then national races where we go out and work for our party.
nonapplause These textbooks will be created in Africa so they will represent the unique experiences of African students.
nonapplause We were saying  the harder you work  the more money you have to reinvest in your business.
nonapplause Thank you so much.
nonapplause I'm proud to report that working with the United States Congress  the number of low-income Americans receiving Pell grants has increased by about a million Americans since I have become the President.
nonapplause All right?
nonapplause Companies are reporting profits.
nonapplause The history of unbreakable ties and sincere friendship between the United States and Greece is well known  but there is a special connection prior to 1821.
nonapplause The Congo is in danger - all these countries which stand poised  facing overwhelming problems  trying to determine whether the way of the future is with us or with the Communists  and within the next decade they will begin to make up their minds.
nonapplause You know  the interesting thing is that when some of our people go overseas  whether it's a skilled man or an unskilled man or a manager  they do marvellously there  not only for themselves  but for the operation and the industry in which they're working.
nonapplause And it will open the avenues for more cultural  even subcultural diplomacy.
nonapplause But why are we in a good position to do well there?
nonapplause And we believed  when I graduated from high school  that we were going to solve the civil rights crisis and the poverty problems of America through the orderly legislative process in Congress and working with people.
nonapplause But a lot of them didn't feel good about it because we made them pay their fair share of taxes and moved a lot of folks out of poverty too.
nonapplause And that starts with giving our children and our families a place in which at least they can be safe and secure.

nonapplause Of course  we want a world in which our relations with the Soviet Union are based upon peace and trust—as they ought to be with every country.

nonapplause At the same time  we will continue  through our own efforts and through supporting efforts by other democracies of Latin America  to explore all possibilities for reconciliation and peace in Central America.
nonapplause We got out from under the thrall of a government which we had hoped would make our lives better  but which wound up trying to live our lives for us.
nonapplause I know you're busy.
nonapplause When they wrote the Constitution and created the vice presidency  they got down to the end of the convention and realized they hadn't given the Vice President anything to do.

nonapplause Nick  I know I speak for all of us when I say thanks for all you're doing.
nonapplause Simple.
nonapplause The campaign season will come in due course -- and when it does  we'll run hard and take nothing for granted.

nonapplause What are the stakes?
nonapplause Productivity is high.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause The defeat of tyranny and violence in that nation  and the rise of democracy in the heart of the Middle East  will be a crucial setback for terror everywhere.
nonapplause And one of the things we're doing  of course  both the President and I are traveling the country  talking to people  trying to elevate the dialogue about Social Security because we think it's an extraordinarily important problem that we need to address  and that it's our responsibility  having just gotten reelected  to work on big issues.
nonapplause We created the Department of Homeland Security; passed the Patriot Act to give law enforcement more authority to be able to prosecute terrorists using tools that were already available to go after drug traffickers and organized crime; passed the Patriot -- Project BioShield  that's specifically aimed at giving the government the authority the develop and stockpile countermeasures that could be used against biological weapons attacks  obviously  improved our transportation arrangements  security in our ports and so forth.
nonapplause I rewrote my talk  here it is.
nonapplause Seniors will start seeing help quickly.
nonapplause Here  too  those rates can and must come down more.
nonapplause It just arrived.
nonapplause And it's our responsibility not to leave them in that position  to show them that there is an alternative  an alternative which the American history shows and illustrates better than anything in the world: that a newly developing country  a new country  wanting progress  can get it  but that they can get it and keep their freedom at the same time.
nonapplause So both Turkey and the United States support a secure and united Iraq that does not serve as a safe haven for terrorists.
nonapplause It's up to each one of you.
nonapplause Why are you joining the voices of dissent?"
nonapplause The question of whether the world will exist half slave and half free  and what contribution we in the United States can make to maintain the world in a state of freedom.
nonapplause Social Security was designed in 1935 for a different world than the one we live in today.
nonapplause And none of our one-liners amount to a hill of beans anymore.
nonapplause Our leading minds have been mobilized to see if it's possible to build a defense system  not to kill people  but to protect them.
nonapplause Then they want to privatize Social Security  and that costs a trillion dollars.
nonapplause That terrible day will live forever as a monument to the worst in human spirit  but the days since will long be remembered as a monument to the very best.
nonapplause As I think all of you probably know  I  myself  owe a great deal to the American Legion for sponsoring this wonderful program that teaches our young people so much about our country and the responsibilities of citizenship.
nonapplause So meeting the deficit challenge will require some very difficult decisions about the largely popular programs that make up the other 97 percent.
nonapplause It's just this simple: Ever since the middle seventies  when Congress shoved the President out of the way and took over the budget process almost entirely  deficits have soared.
nonapplause That's how the foundations of fairness  justice  and balance have been built up in this country  layer upon layer and brick by brick.

nonapplause I'm very proud of your service to our country.
nonapplause We passed the national service law  and I know a lot of you have made good use of the AmeriCorps volunteers.

nonapplause As you get ready to vote on Tuesday  it's important to remember that this election will have enormous consequences for this nation.
nonapplause Today  we got some more evidence that America's economy is on the right track with low unemployment  low inflation and low mortgage rates.
nonapplause This confusion  coupled with the confusion created in the United States by the revelations about arms sales  has at the very least borne in on us the weakness of the solidarity between one partner and another  the gap between words and actions  but  worst of all  the quick succession of such grave developments prompts the question whether there are not much deeper differences on the policies to be adopted in relation to the Middle East  and more specifically in relation to the countries which are involved to a greater or lesser extent in terrorism.
nonapplause I mean  when you have Alan Dershowitz and Alan Keyes agreeing to decry the same thing  you got to know something's wrong.
nonapplause Come to think of it  that band was my first real experience in entertainment.
nonapplause But if you look at that  you'll see a lot of the basic ideas that were laid out there that we think are important priorities for us in the years ahead.
nonapplause If you lived in a tiny village in the Andes where you didn't know where your child's next meal was coming from  you wouldn't have the time to be cynical.
nonapplause We met with Deborah and Sandee and other wives of the Joint Chiefs to get their advice and guidance on how to develop our initiatives  and that was incredibly helpful.
nonapplause The generosity of the employers in West Virginia wasn't learned in MBA textbooks or in business schools.
nonapplause And I sent reinforcements to our troops so they can accomplish that mission.
nonapplause As you can see  I've been joined by some citizens from Ohio here on the stage.
nonapplause We have learned in over 200 years that every day democracy must be defended  and a more perfect union can always lie ahead.
nonapplause Ultimately they result from a failure to meet the test that Lincoln set.
nonapplause So when it comes to the sphere of our work —- building a future of greater prosperity  opportunity and security for our people  there is no doubt: I have to go to India.
nonapplause The plan can grow tax-free  which is an encouragement for people to make wise decisions about how they treat their body.
nonapplause Now  let me say a word about what happened in 1997.
nonapplause We have federal agencies that are working again in fundamental ways to engage the business community in the growth of the economy all around the world.
nonapplause That's fundamentally different and rampant.
nonapplause And many people have asked me why a conference on teenagers.
nonapplause And no one's out there running against the government anymore.
nonapplause These are huge challenges.
nonapplause We can make America stronger not just economically and militarily  but also morally and spiritually.
nonapplause We must act now because it is the right thing to do.

nonapplause And I want you to get involved and stay involved and never stop.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President At Minner Reception
nonapplause We see in our national parks what America used to be.
nonapplause And for the first time in our history  we will probably suffer more casualties here at home in America than will our troops overseas.
nonapplause And it just shows that America's families are contributing and giving to our nation.
nonapplause This man comes to the United States  and what does he do?
nonapplause Well  a couple of years ago  I was amazed to see some people that didn't look like ordinary workmen in Washington  DC  nailing shingles on a roof and others painting a porch and so forth.
nonapplause I was quite impressed -- very focused.

nonapplause More than a million American service members have deployed here since the conflict began.
nonapplause That means you.
nonapplause This is a very special day  obviously.

nonapplause It's the choice between the policies of liberalism or the policies of America's political mainstream.
nonapplause This great and urgent responsibility has required a shift in our national security strategy.
nonapplause And in that battle  Jim fought tooth and nail against fierce liberal opposition in the House.
nonapplause So when it comes right down to it  this is also about protecting your bottom lines and meeting the demands of your customers -- customers who I know you want to keep coming back again and again.
nonapplause Don't you want somebody like that in the White House when we have to decide who gets a hold of your medical and financial records that are on the Internet?

nonapplause I said  one of the things I admired about President Yeltsin is he has a great imagination.
nonapplause And Bill Verity tells me that they're doing even more in response to the challenge of our task force  and they're doing it more efficiently and effectively than the Federal Government ever could.
nonapplause Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness.
nonapplause That's a high class problem  having people living longer and well.
nonapplause It is comforting to know that our leaders in the Council are together in their solidarity concerning the need to help Poland and the need to make certain that there is no outside intervention from any other country such as Russia.
nonapplause I know hospitals rely on these payments now  legitimately  because of the large number of uninsured patients that they treat.
nonapplause It will save $77 billion over the next ten years for the manufacturing sector of America.
nonapplause And in the first 2 months of 1988  Soviet military assistance to Nicaragua has almost doubled  compared to the same period in 1987.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the People of the Macon Area
nonapplause People my age have in mind  as I said  that our responsibility is to see that when it comes your turn to take over we turn over to you the same freedom  the same great opportunity that the preceding generations have turned over to us.
nonapplause And yet as the darkness abounds  hope abounds even more.
nonapplause That's why we will ask the task force to work with the entertainment and media industries to create a single web site to help parents make sense of all the various rating systems  and use them to monitor their children's interactions with the media.
nonapplause You want me to stop because I'm embarrassing you.
nonapplause I feel there is enormous potential for more British goods and services in Japan which I believe the Japanese people and we in Britain would greatly welcome.

nonapplause Maryland has been my home in many senses.
nonapplause Served eight years in the House  eight in the Senate  presided over the Senate for eight as vice president.
nonapplause And we welcome the assistance of our allies.
nonapplause Who can be so ill informed that he thinks the tensions of the power struggle disappear by good will missions  by debates  and by arguments.
nonapplause In Bosnia and Kosovo  even in Darfur there is an effort being made now  and I have some thoughts about that if you want to talk about it.
nonapplause Under tax relief signed by President Bush  25 million small business owners have received tax cuts averaging $3 600 a year just last year alone.
nonapplause We need to understand the entrepreneurial spirit.
nonapplause There are 40 million people retired today; another 33 million will be retired when the baby boomers fully retire.
nonapplause And then I met with the choir afterward  and a bunch of the students and  gosh  there were Irish kids  and Italian kids  and Jewish kids  and there were Arab-American kids  and there were Hispanic kids from a bunch of different countries; and there were Chinese kids  Japanese kids  Thai kids  kids from the Indian subcontinent  both Indians and Pakistanis.
nonapplause My pay actually comes from the Senate.
nonapplause And I had this vision that we could get young people involved in service and help them go to college.
nonapplause We need both and we will have both.
nonapplause Both our families have known losses -- and hers very recently -- and we appreciate her being here.
nonapplause No more fast track.
nonapplause Will you choose the Democratic leaders  who in 1980 weakened our nation and nearly brought our economy to its knees  who raised your taxes and have announced their plans to do so again  who oppose our efforts to pursue a defense to protect us from attack by nuclear ballistic missiles?
nonapplause There's not a person in this room tonight  not one over 30  who cannot remember one time in your life when you made a mistake  not because things were going so poorly  but because things were going so well you thought there was no penalty for your failure to concentrate.
nonapplause It was a difficult situation for a President of the United States to go to a conference and then to be subjected to insult - never perhaps equaled in the relation between nations at a conference table in the history of the world.
nonapplause That's his bill.
nonapplause Instead  it simply directs to Treasury to make payments to everybody who applies and qualifies for the benefits under the laws.
nonapplause We could take Social Security and Medicare out there beyond the life of the baby boomers and add that prescription drug benefit.
nonapplause And maybe things can't change after all.
nonapplause The overriding goal during the past 2 years has been to give the government back to the American people  to make it responsive again to their wishes and desires  to do more than bring about a healthy economy or a growing gross national product.
nonapplause Unfortunately  that's not as funny as you think it is.
nonapplause Well  I'm delighted that here today with us the Pinellas Park High School Band  the Seminole High School Band  and the Tampa Bay Buccaneer Pep Band.
nonapplause Now  I think sometimes these ballot initiatives have dealt with real problems  but at least from my point of view  with the wrong solution.
nonapplause But it's not going to come easy  it's not going to come quick.
nonapplause We act for the sake of future generations  to whom we are obliged under God to pass on this providential gift of liberty.
nonapplause But the states have it and they will live to regret it if they don't spend the money now to make folks independent and put them into the workplace and put them into the mainstream of American life.
nonapplause Why do I say we get back to it?
nonapplause You will listen to the arguments and issues in this campaign  and I think by the end you may decide your home is with us.
nonapplause And I just have to tell you at the risk  however  as I say  of endangering myself in this  I received a letter not too long ago from the Ambassador to Luxembourg.
nonapplause Yes  sir   We are on the move now.
nonapplause I'm reading now.
nonapplause The President and I welcome the discussion because every voter in the United States needs to know where we stand  as well as how the leaders of the Democratic Party view the war on terror.

nonapplause Threats are still out there.
nonapplause In Saddam Hussein  we had one of the world's worst  obviously.

nonapplause From Marines going into combat and dominating the battle space  to the precision strikes of the Air Force  to the Army brigades holding and operating across wide terrain  to Navy corpsmen risking their lives to help the wounded  and to Seabees all over the country  day and night  preparing runways  fixing water pumps  and doing a hundred other tasks  Americans serving in Iraq have been absolutely superb.
nonapplause She'll join us tonight in Milwaukee.
nonapplause Matt Welsh  Senator Hartke  Congressman Denton  Mr. Mayor  national committeewoman and Mrs. Price  Grover Cleveland's strongest supporter   and ladies and gentlemen  I am delighted to come to this community only 3 or 4 days after Mr. Nixon  because I think this community and this State has a very clear decision to make on next November 8  which affects the welfare of this district  and affects the welfare of this State  and affects the welfare of this Nation.
nonapplause In this time of testing for our country  we understand that our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people.
nonapplause There's also Lieutenant Lisa Starr  a United States Navy Nurse  who volunteered for a nighttime flight in Iraq during a sandstorm that had grounded all medical helicopters to save the life of a wounded Marine.
nonapplause You heard the Vice President talking about it.
nonapplause And if that ratio between this temperature and that temperature changes  then the pattern can change.
nonapplause It's time to speak up for America.
nonapplause Spending discipline is crucial to the President's economic program.
nonapplause Sometimes we have agreement  we're going to agrees on two things that I think are great -- I'll give the Republicans a little pat on the back here -- the Congress is going to overwhelmingly vote  apparently  to renew the disability on disabled Americans who go in the work force and lose their Medicaid coverage.
nonapplause He talks about the strength that he gains from working with a democratic leader like the Prime Minister and the people of Japan to solve the world's continuing problems  whether on the North Korean peninsula or in Iraq or in Afghanistan  or fighting disease and poverty.
nonapplause There is a broad agreement on that.
nonapplause This year the Congress has provided  largely on a completely bipartisan basis  perhaps the most important education reforms we have had in a generation -- a total reform of the Head Start system serving more children at a younger age; expansion of childhood immunization; the Goals 2000 bill  which sets international educational goals for all of our schools and encourages grass-roots reforms to meet them; the school-to-work transition bill which trains young people who don't go on to college  but who do need at least two years of further training to get good jobs with a growing income.
nonapplause I want to thank President Mills for his outstanding leadership.
nonapplause The face of injustice is not compassion; it is indifference  or worse.
nonapplause Was that just a nuisance attack?
nonapplause There's a lot of issues that we face in Washington  or here in Chicago.
nonapplause The heart and soul of the American people is really the strength of our country.
nonapplause One of the big problems here in preventing these crimes is that you've got so many of these little churches that are out on country roads  and they're old wooden structures  and they don't even have a full-time staff  so they can't afford to have full-time people there as night watchmen.
nonapplause And no political party should let itself sort of just kind of disintegrate into petty bickering and small-minded politics.
nonapplause I'm for the kind of extremism that those who are being destroyed by those bombs and destroyed by those hired killers are able to put forth to thwart it.
nonapplause This has been important throughout our history  and in the future it will be more important than ever before  because education will be more important than ever before.
nonapplause One year ago we liberated Grenada from Communists who had taken over that country.
nonapplause Thank you all very much  and God bless you all.

nonapplause So the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree.
nonapplause My two girls and Eleanor are clapping right now that we're not going to have to sell the house.
nonapplause We now know that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction  and posed no imminent threat to our security.

nonapplause Are we going to vote Democratic?
nonapplause We want to respect your training  your judgment and your knowledge  and not unduly interfere with what you do.
nonapplause And that's what this New Markets Initiative is all about.

nonapplause They see violence on the streets  they see violence in their homes  and rather than being emotionally disturbed  they're being trained to be okay.

nonapplause And I got to say also of Ty Lawson  you had an unbelievable series  so congratulations -- playing a little gimpy and still just tearing it up.
nonapplause The moral of this story  Mr. President  is that we have seen a world that might exist  a world of which we can be proud  a world in which the tools for change are available to all of the world's people  a world in which all are in fact equal citizens.
nonapplause But you just remember this.
nonapplause His commander's name -- John Chafee.
nonapplause Well no  that's not right.
nonapplause And we know what to do.
nonapplause It's where I peaked.
nonapplause Together  we must do more to close the gap.
nonapplause Usually speaking to an audience I add a God bless you  but I know God already has blessed all of you.
nonapplause This is an historic achievement  a landmark document in that region.
nonapplause I'd also like to say a special word today.
nonapplause So basically  what they're really betting on -- I mean  their whole campaign strategy is that all of you have come down with a case of amnesia.
nonapplause I know how hard it is as a parent when you're bombarded by ads for junk food; when you're hit with a barrage of conflicting stories about what's healthy and what's not; when you always feel like you're failing to meet some impossible standard for working parents -- or for any parents for that matter.
nonapplause But there are a lot of NGOs that you never hear about that are also changing the lives of every person they touch.
nonapplause I remember thinking at the time what a very sensible  noble and far-seeing aim that was.
nonapplause He fought hard for the healthy forest legislation  a vital action that helps thin the undergrowth and reduce the risk of catastrophic fire.
nonapplause I just hope that one of the things we can all do to --coming out of this  is not only to make sure that the police forces in our diverse communities are themselves properly diverse -- that's important  but that's not all there is to it  because you're never going to be having a time when there won't be  let's say  black police officers who have to arrest Hispanics  and Asian police officers have to arrest white people or  you know  whatever it is.
nonapplause And that means that as we respond to it  not every judgment we make is going to be right the first time out.
nonapplause — Nationalisation of the banks—and of course  your savings in them.
nonapplause Now if you believe that  that's an important idea -- you need to know if you believe that.
nonapplause Secretary Bentsen set the Treasury on the right course  emphasizing deficit reduction  cooperation for growth around the world.
nonapplause Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948  and on the issues which matter  housing  social security  medical care for the aged minimum wage  development of the resources of this country  I believe the Democratic Party looks forward.
nonapplause Mr. President  thank you for that welcome.
nonapplause See  I had met Cory before  back at the D-Day anniversary in Normandy.
nonapplause This rise of state power affected my life as it did the lives of many of your parents and nearly all of your grandparents.
nonapplause And it was calibrated to fight crime in several ways: It had more police  more punishment  more prisons and more prevention.
nonapplause We need them  and I am proud of that law.
nonapplause And that's what we'll celebrate tomorrow  that's what we celebrate tonight  and that's what we will celebrate in the future.
nonapplause The legislation will speed up the process of Federal approval of inexpensive generic versions of many brand name drugs  make the generic versions more widely available to consumers  and grant pharmaceutical firms added incentives to develop new drugs.

nonapplause We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions -- from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank -- that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.

nonapplause This report shows that if you're a teenager or a parent  it is nearly impossible to avoid seeing or hearing our anti-drug messages on television or radio several times a week.
nonapplause But then when I got this job --   -- and I would be approaching Air Force One or Marine One and those marines would come to a salute and I -- knowing that I am in civilian clothes -- I would nod and say hello and think they could drop their hand  and they wouldn't.

nonapplause Cocaine use dropped by a third in America in three years  but casual drug use has been going up among people under 18 since 1991.
nonapplause And if you believe it would all stop under nice  cosy  Democratic Socialism next week  I must remind you what kind of Labour party it would be next time in Parliament.
nonapplause And we're going to do so.
nonapplause What this President has accomplished in three-and-a-half years is remarkable  but the danger has not passed.
nonapplause And when I put my hand on the Bible  I swore to uphold that responsibility  and I will.
nonapplause This is a very new and different time.
nonapplause Senator Kerry said  and I quote  "I've met foreign leaders who can't go out and say this publicly  but  boy  they look at you and say  you've got to win this  you've got to beat this guy  we need a new policy  things like that."
nonapplause -- that'll be quite an improvement from what we inherited  because in 1981  as I said last night  we inherited the worst economic crisis in postwar history.
nonapplause And I'm proud to say -- on another subject -- that during these last 4 years  not 1 square inch of territory in the world has been lost to Communist aggression.
nonapplause But the leaders did not lose faith.
nonapplause As President  I swore an oath to preserve  protect and defend our Constitution.
nonapplause Because  in a very real way  I would not be here as President if it weren't for Chicago.
nonapplause And this new director might be better off with that legal authority than all the tens of thousands of people we can give him in a government reorganization.
nonapplause And I'm told it's the first time ever that government has gone  as we have  not to the people who can give you a theory about getting people off of welfare  but to the people who've done it themselves  in practice  or helped others do it.
nonapplause They were the worst form of criminals themselves  but with their lies they were able to project themselves as pilgrims who were so religious  they were coming to this country so they could practice their religion.
nonapplause And you find that the top ten per cent of the population over eighteen own less than half of personal wealth when state pension rights are counted as an asset  as they should be.
nonapplause I cast what may well be the last vote of a long and rich life in my native state of Arkansas for Al Gore for President.
nonapplause I'm here to talk about the Social Security system.
nonapplause That's why I'm here  because I can't bring the change I promised all by myself.
nonapplause There will be no summit meeting  no negotiations with terrorists.
nonapplause That would be your Vice President.
nonapplause And I ask your help in this campaign.
nonapplause We are encouraged by the fact  as Mr. Casey Stengel showed us this week  experience perhaps does not count.
nonapplause And we will seize this opportunity.
nonapplause They opposed the liberation of Grenada.
nonapplause Now  I have no illusion about how much work lies ahead and how hard it will be.
nonapplause It will also help to alleviate the financial problems of a lot of our health care providers  and we need to do it.
nonapplause Now  in the last few weeks  we've had some pretty good news on that.
nonapplause We're grateful to every musician who keeps that heritage so rich and so vital today.
nonapplause We have set challenges to schools to recognize that they must impart the basic values that keep our society together  through character education and teaching good values and good citizenship.
nonapplause A well educated mind is our key strategic asset.
nonapplause We know where we're going: We're going onward  we're going upward  and we're not leaving anyone behind.
nonapplause And if anything happened to us  if we'd done anything to damage them  then we would be damaging our prospects in the whole of the future.
nonapplause The second thing we ought to do is to keep working on the schools.

nonapplause The United States has a clear interest in helping India meet this demand with nuclear energy.
nonapplause And it is causing many parts of America to lose qualified doctors.
nonapplause They just want people to stand up and talk to them about real things that make a difference  like how we raise the wages of workers  how we make the workplace fair  how we don't go backwards on a 40-hour work week and continue to pay people overtime that they deserve  how we create the jobs of the future.
nonapplause I also want to thank all the members of the Florida Regional Domestic Security Task Force for the work that you've put in.
nonapplause I mean  it didn't take but five minutes before he was explaining how he was going to rain down jumpers on me.
nonapplause I am delighted to be here.
nonapplause So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly inreconcilable truths -- that war is sometimes necessary  and war at some level is an expression of human folly.
nonapplause Be seated  please.
nonapplause She's running for the State House.
nonapplause He became an engineer.
nonapplause It would undermine what we're trying to do to promote safety in commuter airlines.
nonapplause And let the others keep trying to cut defense.

nonapplause I ask all public  private and home schools to join our Lessons for Liberty Initiative  by inviting a veteran to speak to your students during the week of Veterans Day.

nonapplause An official at the U.S. mission to the U.N. remarked  we were as surprised as anyone when Kerry started talking about a meeting with the Security Council.
nonapplause The unemployment rate is the lowest in 28 years  the percentage of Americans on welfare the lowest in 29 years  the inflation rate the lowest in 33 years.
nonapplause We join those in the interim government who seek education and better health for every Afghan woman and child.
nonapplause He understands the need to reduce demand.
nonapplause But every time I got the chance during the debates  though  I tried to point out to audiences that they ought to be standing back from that kind of discussion and asking themselves a simple question.
nonapplause And today  I'm proud that I've been given this opportunity to be a part of repaying you for all that you've done for America.
nonapplause We need a policy that encourages the development of new sources of energy in an environmentally friendly way.
nonapplause Good evening  everybody.
nonapplause We're seeing record exports for farm products.
nonapplause So he's been a business executive  he's somebody who's run a school system and made it work for children  and then he decided  well  let me try this U.S. Senate thing.
nonapplause Let's put away the video games.
nonapplause It is beautiful.
nonapplause There's a lot that's changed  a lot that's changed.
nonapplause I want to thank -- thank you.
nonapplause "Oh " he said  "I guess politician."
nonapplause I want to thank you for this tremendous welcome this morning.
nonapplause Expanding trade is also the answer to our most pressing international financial problem -- the mounting debt of many developing countries.
nonapplause We're seeing that all over southern California.
nonapplause Only if they're very lucky and rise high in the Communist Party will any of them have influence on the course of history that each American has by just walking into the voting booth.
nonapplause Workers do that regularly.
nonapplause Something there doesn't add up.
nonapplause Number one  on economic policy.
nonapplause She said to them  "you can kill me  you can kill my family  but you can't kill us all."
nonapplause I do not ask you to choose merely between two men.
nonapplause And with the recent passage of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act  a bipartisan effort  we are now poised to usher in a new era of service in this nation.
nonapplause I want to thank all the coaches for working with the kids.
nonapplause So  we decided to rebuild and be strong again.
nonapplause Now even as we fight the wars in front of us  we also have to see the horizon beyond these wars -- because unlike a terrorist whose goal is to destroy  our future will be defined by what we build.
nonapplause That economic plan brought the deficit down four years in a row for the first time in a president's administration since the 1840s; that's how long it had been since that happened.
nonapplause We now know that sometime in '98 they began a much smaller effort to make fewer nuclear weapons with highly enriched uranium in a laboratory.
nonapplause I did not invent the 5 or 6 million Americans that live out their lives waiting for food packages from the Federal Government which amount to 5 cents per day per person.
nonapplause Now  all of us know our work is not yet done.
nonapplause It's wonderful to be back with you today.
nonapplause But I'm also disappointed -- as I said  a week from today we end the fiscal year and we start a new one.
nonapplause And it is  but it gives you the benefit of memory.
nonapplause They are exactly the kind of jobs we need for a new generation of Americans.
nonapplause And this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people  and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm.
nonapplause His role in our regulatory reform effort should suggest the importance that we place on this issue.
nonapplause At some point there will be over 100 million  and at some point  some threshold that no one can identify with precision will be crossed and it will be a very different world.
nonapplause Confident in our future and secure in our values  Americans are striving forward to embrace the future.
nonapplause And we will be.
nonapplause It could be clear way ahead  and you would think that there are all kind of obstacles in the way.
nonapplause That's what you've been doing here.
nonapplause "The pursuit of equality"—I'm quoting—"has developed in and unprecedented manner and this fact has become one of the most important obstacles to intensive economic development and higher living standards.
nonapplause No languages—you can't lay claim to any language  not even English; you mess it up.
nonapplause Because  if I may  there are two students in particular I'd like to recognize -- I hope I have the name right: Mr. Patrick Lafontant and Mr. Gregory B. Owens.
nonapplause Now  just before we took office  he said of our economic program  that it is obviously  murderously inflationary.
nonapplause And that still wasn't good enough for John Kerry.
nonapplause Americans still get up and go to work.
nonapplause We are now meeting for a year.
nonapplause And many of you have friends who live outside San Francisco  live in one of these congressional districts where we're trying to win a Democratic seat; or maybe you have friends beyond the state of California  who live in battleground states where one or two or three or 10 votes could make a difference.
nonapplause That is such a tiny amount of money.
nonapplause I hope they'll continue to put aside partisan advantage and strive for what is necessary and what is right.
nonapplause And we ought to be happy about doing our duty.
nonapplause I guess what I'm trying to say is  I've taken a common sense approach to your money.
nonapplause What's needed is a positive programme for revival carried out by a Government that really believes in the policies it is pursuing and is united in its resolve to see them through.
nonapplause But now let me say hello to Earl Cantos; to Congressmen Duncan Hunter and Bill Lowery; and to a great future Congressman we'll all be proud of  Rob Butterfield; and to one of America's greatest Governors  George Deukmejian; and to one of the finest Senators I know  Pete Wilson.
nonapplause It doesn't matter where you are now.
nonapplause Here's what I think.
nonapplause I am confident that the Democratic Party will be called once again to assume its historic task of providing leadership in a dangerous time in the life of our country.
nonapplause We know that we will never abolish crime in America.
nonapplause But what we can say is that an economy that was shrinking rapidly is now growing again; that businesses that were shedding workers are now hiring again; that consumers are now spending again; that business investment is taking place again; that the financial market is stabilized and a lot of folks who were counting on that 401(k) being there for their retirement  that that has not -- if not completely been restored in value  has come a long way from those dark days just a year ago.
nonapplause And so the American people have got to decide.
nonapplause Everybody  raise your hands  all of our chefs at the White House who are -- who have helped to make sure that this garden grows and that we get good food  and they make it  and it's good  and it's healthy.
nonapplause We're eliminating co-pays for veterans who are catastrophically disabled.
nonapplause Opening doors  closing doors  letting us know what paths  sending folks to us and so forth.
nonapplause I think we would all admit that.
nonapplause The River really links our country together  and so I'm going to start here and then I'm going to go down to Missouri  to talk to some farmers.
nonapplause You know better than anyone else what drugs can do to our children's minds  bodies  and lives.
nonapplause When the doors of college were closed to all but white students  and black people's aspirations were scorned  Historically Black Colleges and Universities gave young African Americans the high quality education they deserved  the pride they needed to rise above cruelty and bigotry.
nonapplause And if you both have a big tax cut and privatize a part of Social Security  and guarantee the benefits to all the people that are older  you spend all the surplus and then some right there  before you spend a nickel on anything else.
nonapplause And to those of you who might be thinking of following the same course  I want to encourage you to do so.
nonapplause And that means it's important.
nonapplause He added  "Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."
nonapplause All of the things that I've told you about  and more -- that we've accomplished in the few years we've been there -- I tell you  frankly  could not have been accomplished if we did not have  for the first time in years and years  a majority  a small majority  but a majority in the one House  the Senate.
nonapplause And when you combine in one place  under one will  on a permanent basis all the powers of government  you do not have a constitution  you do not have a republic  you do not have freedom.
nonapplause "We can't do it."
nonapplause But we need to keep our eyes on the objective  and increasing economic cooperation is in the interest of the ordinary citizens of the United States and the rest of the world.
nonapplause Well  just sitting around in the zoo and making faces at the kids got a little boring.
nonapplause So you see  it's either God and country  or it's no country at all for us.
nonapplause Yes to lower deficits.
nonapplause Cuba is host to a Soviet combat brigade  a submarine base capable of servicing Soviet submarines  and military air bases visited regularly by Soviet military aircraft.
nonapplause And more and more  we need preventive care and chronic care.
nonapplause Our credit markets were frozen  folks couldn't get a home loan  they couldn't get a car loan  they couldn't get a student loan if they needed it.
nonapplause These rights are God-given  and not State-given.
nonapplause Never in time.
nonapplause And then he looked at the Astro's general manager who was present and said  "I will be back."
nonapplause Back in those days  when that gentleman and I were members of the party --   -- its leaders weren't in the “blame America first” crowd.
nonapplause It was Winston Churchill who understood the danger of weakness and appeasement more than anyone else.
nonapplause We're calling on other nations to help the Iraqis build a free society  which will make all of us more secure.
nonapplause So my only official title is as the President of the Senate.
nonapplause But when you find a person who has a knowledge of things of the world today  he realizes that what happens in South Vietnam can affect him if he's living on St. Nicholas Avenue  or what's happening in the Congo affects his situation on Eighth Avenue or Seventh Avenue or Lenox Avenue.
nonapplause The last time I came was in 1982 on an official visit and things have changed in both countries quite a lot since then.
nonapplause It has reached in some communities the point of a capital levy  and we cannot expect that the property tax will furnish  in the 1960's  the same income for the sustenance of the public sector that it has sustained in the 1940's and the 1950's.
nonapplause They're doing it in Colorado too  and revising their juvenile justice system to reflect the violent realities of our time.
nonapplause etc.
nonapplause So  believe me  I welcome this approach by the opposition.
nonapplause And I hope tonight and these next couple of weeks are the greatest time of your life.
nonapplause In the two world wars of the last century  through the long struggle to defend liberty and defeat communism in Europe and in Asia  to the regional conflicts of the decade that followed  Canada and the United States have fought and stood together.
nonapplause It sounds complex.
nonapplause It is evident that if our youngest children are nurtured and educated  in our families and in our schools  then a great number of social ills can be averted before they arise.
nonapplause When considering these essential programs  please remember the very best thing that can be done to strengthen things like social security is to get the American economy going and put people back to work  so they will be paying into the trust fund once again.
nonapplause Ideas practiced in Boston.
nonapplause Well  doctors make more money in cities  doctors have more support in cities  and  frankly  our medical schools are turning out too many specialists and too few general practitioners for the needs of not just people in rural areas  but all over the country.
nonapplause We have been working on this for three years at some level of intensity or another  going back to the Naples G-7 meeting in the aftermath of the Mexican financial crisis.
nonapplause Even though you're here tonight  they'll still have more money than we do for the next few weeks -- quite a bit more.
nonapplause I suspect some in Washington wish I hadn't have brought it up  because some in Washington really don't want to deal with it.
nonapplause That number may reach $1.4 trillion in three years.
nonapplause And that's as it should be.
nonapplause Those slots  two  had already been filled.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause I just have serious doubts about his willingness or his ability or his conviction that would lead to the notion that he could somehow successfully prosecute the war on terror as aggressively as I believe it needs to be prosecuted in order to safeguard the nation here at home.
nonapplause So I think other countries will be probably trying to figure out how they can follow China's lead over the next three or four years  but being forthright about the facts is very important.
nonapplause The Middle East is the best example.
nonapplause Their work would continue as the Rocket and Satellite Research Panel.
nonapplause When nations accept the rules of the modern world  they discover the benefits of the modern world.
nonapplause Their commanding officer  a general  will be retiring at the end of the month.

nonapplause But I think it's important that we maintain some historic perspective.

nonapplause Our future depends on it.
nonapplause The membership of the party by the millions  long ago  has turned to the right  and they're still the leadership marching down the street.
nonapplause We can do that -- and honor every constitutional provision in our founding document  and every fundamental value in our society.
nonapplause He'd come back up just in time to turn the band  and I was going down the street all alone  and the band had taken a turn to the right.
nonapplause I believe it was truly a turning point  and we think we've set American education on a much better course.
nonapplause I hope that Congress will agree with me to give a tax deduction for the cost of tuition for college.
nonapplause Our two nations have committed many resources to that struggle  but we have it within our power at this moment to take an historic step toward a growing world economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches beyond the industrialized powers even to the developing nations.
nonapplause In the last four years  two exceptionally gifted leaders -- my friends  the late Ron Brown and Mickey Kantor -- have headed that department and turned it into an economic powerhouse for the American people.

nonapplause And as I said  the thing I'm  quite frankly  proudest of is that dog hasn't bitten yet.
nonapplause But you're not good enough to know how to spend the lion's share of your own money  but we are good enough to know  not only how to spend what is right and proper and due and should be paid to Government  but we are free and good enough to spend your money for you'.

nonapplause I would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do together -- not as Republicans and Democrats  but as Americans -- to make tomorrow's America happy and prosperous at home  strong and respected abroad  and at peace in the world.
nonapplause We have ignored Latin America and the result is that a candidate for the Presidency of Brazil felt it necessary to go to Havana and pay a call on Castro in order to secure the support of Castro supporters in the last election.
nonapplause This is the law of change with which we all will live  and which we will either use to help make us more prosperous or walk away from and pay the penalty.
nonapplause The only problem is that we're not starting from scratch.
nonapplause This administration needs to explain how we went from a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion when President Clinton left office to now we're dealing with a projected deficit of 2.3 trillion.
nonapplause And that means higher interest rates and all those bad things.
nonapplause I thanked them for their service  and for all they've done to bring freedom  stability  and peace to a troubled part of the world.
nonapplause But  that idea of consent--where does it come from?
nonapplause Since Desert Storm  America has worked steadily and persistently to contain the threat Saddam poses  through sanctions that deny him billions every year to rebuild his military; and  where necessary  with force.
nonapplause Democrats can move this country forward from underfunded schools  underpaid teachers  and undereducated youths to making education our top funding priority and providing free college education for all.
nonapplause The giving part was all forgotten.
nonapplause Finally  even as you've been buffeted by Katrina and Rita  even as you've been impacted by the broader recession that has devastated communities across the country  in recent months the Gulf Coast has seen new hardship as a result of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
nonapplause It means Senator Danforth.
nonapplause Party label in Wyoming brings no guarantees -- as evidenced by the fact that only two Republicans have been elected governor in the last four decades.
nonapplause This is the task before us: to plead the case of humanity  to move the conscience of the world  to march together -- as in olden times -- in the cause of freedom.
nonapplause We've spent a lot of time trying to harden the target here at home to make the United States a much tougher target than we were before 9/11  created the new Department of Homeland Security  the biggest reorganization of the federal government since the late 1940s  when we created the Department of Defense.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President on a Jobs Tax Credit in Baltimore  Maryland
nonapplause But that 19.5 misery index we inherited is  for the first quarter of 1982  only 9.8 percent.
nonapplause If we are maintaining full employment  if we are using our productive capacity to the fullest  if we are building a better society here  then it reflects itself around the globe.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to Seniors Citizens from Connecticut
nonapplause Because  otherwise  you're looking at a population  by the turn of the century and the end of the first decade of the next century which we simply cannot afford to maintain  and would be bad for our country unless we have more different options to deal with this rapidly aging population.
nonapplause Of course  ultimately  change is about more than just policies in our government.
nonapplause Each of you serves the United States of America in a period of national challenge  military transformation  and unprecedented threats.
nonapplause I know the Anti-Defamation League has justly earned the recognition as a champion of human rights.
nonapplause Because the people who wanted the full time jobs had no way to get there.

nonapplause All this has significance to the position of the United States and the world around us.
nonapplause And Rosa Parks famously experienced it when that bus driver had her arrested for refusing his order to give up her seat to a white man.
nonapplause But obviously  it's another example of the kind of problem we've got with those who resort to terror to try achieve their political objectives as happened in that case.
nonapplause Just that alone  just that change alone would go a long way  a significant way for doing our duty to permanently fix the Social Security problem for a younger generation of Americans.
nonapplause These are historic times.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause Yet  even in the midst of this terrible tragedy  we also see the people of Littleton pulling together to pray and comfort and sustain each other.
nonapplause And there  we will find them.
nonapplause For eight months  I have been trying to pass a patients' bill of rights.
nonapplause Change never is.
nonapplause Or when after hundreds of years of fighting in Northern Ireland  they want the United States to bring people here who are on opposite sides and let them come to America and see people who share their roots and try to work through this.
nonapplause These will only grow in importance  and they set an agenda for the decades ahead.
nonapplause You mentioned  Secretary Slater mentioned the meeting we had in Everett  Washington.
nonapplause And you know  the interesting thing is every time I think through one of these issues -- could be crime  could be education  could be welfare or something -- it always comes to the same point!
nonapplause The defining domestic issue  assuming we'll be able to get to domestic issues  is health care.
nonapplause Now  you know  we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and the Levite didn't stop.
nonapplause My only official duty is as President of the Senate.
nonapplause And though many difficulties lie ahead  the United States must remain a constant friend to both nations.
nonapplause It's all right  I like it.
nonapplause We're never going to do that again.
nonapplause And a lot of people are -- a man who was laughing I assume has just educated two or three kids already in college.
nonapplause And these three people from different worlds asked me to support an initiative to try to get to the point where the wealthier countries in the world could offer every poor child in the world a nutritious meal in school if they'd show up to school.
nonapplause That isn't what you meant by 4 more years  was it?
nonapplause And nowhere is this challenge more vital to our own security than in Central America.
nonapplause So Valerie's mother moved all the way from Australia to Kentucky to take care of her grandchildren.

nonapplause ﻿  President's Remarks at Jon Kyl for Senate Dinner
nonapplause So we're trying to improve that.
nonapplause This step will also help our own country to move forward on an issue that has separated Americans from one another for too long now.
nonapplause It's because men and women of every race  from every walk of life  continue to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest.
nonapplause You got some of the folks kind of excited when I mentioned your name.
nonapplause And somehow we have to implant in the soul of every child that age-old seed of learning so that the future can be ours.
nonapplause Is there any kind of national organization of people like you  who are working for family-centered care everywhere and advocating it?
nonapplause In the Declaration of Independence itself  Thomas Jefferson wrote all men are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights."
nonapplause Indeed  after years of patchwork fixes and ill-conceived revisions  the legal immigration system is as broken as the borders.
nonapplause Yes to hope.
nonapplause We just commissioned -- let me give you an example -- we just commissioned a supercomputer between IBM and the federal government -- we're going to build one that will do more calculations in a second than a person with a hand-held calculator can do in 30 000 years.
nonapplause That's one reason why I want Ron Klink to be there -- because the progressive party has become the fiscally conservative party.
nonapplause The second thing we have to do is to help people help themselves.
nonapplause And that means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth.
nonapplause At the time Senator Wallop and I were first elected to statewide office in the late ‘70s  the federal government was showing signs of growing beyond the consent of the governed  and it wasn't particularly easy to take on the permanent bureaucracy here in Washington.
nonapplause It comes at a crucial time in our history.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause In this case  we'll be laying the foundation for a full-fledged summit which  if things go right in these preparatory sessions  will be held here in the United States.
nonapplause Here in Washington  the FEMA Emergency Support Team is operating at Level One  its highest level  on a 24-hour basis.
nonapplause We have anywhere between a quarter of a million and 300 000 people dead.
nonapplause People have talked for years about trying to get the kind of high standards and accountability in our schools all across the nation so that people could expect to have schools as good as the ones here in Iowa.
nonapplause That sounds more like a movie review of "The Untouchables."
nonapplause He says  and I think he honest believes  because he led the fight against it repeatedly  that it was an antibusiness initiative because it was a government requirement on companies of 50 or more employees that you couldn't fire somebody if they had to take a little time off when a baby was born to them or their spouse  or when there was a sick parent or when there was some other medical emergency in the family.
nonapplause I don't think either one of us then ever dreamed that we'd end up where we are today  with Bill as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and me serving as Vice President.
nonapplause So I think maybe we're  by fits and starts  moving toward our one America.
nonapplause Democracy guarantees opportunity  not success.
nonapplause I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership.
nonapplause I said in the State of the Union and I say again to you here  there are at least seven major challenges we have to face if we're going to fulfill our mission of opening the American Dream to all Americans who will work for it  and pulling the American family together  and maintaining America's leadership.
nonapplause But it sounds good.
nonapplause What's even worse are the effects on our children.
nonapplause And the other group of course  is the al Qaeda types  Mr. Zarqawi  who wants us to leave Iraq.
nonapplause This administration has tried to pursue this demand in two ways.
nonapplause They pass it on to you.
nonapplause The sister replied  "Oh  nothing much.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause To Franklin Graham  thank you  sir  for the remarkable work that you are doing and for giving people like Mary the chance to be remarkable in their own right.
nonapplause Now  let me spend just a minute on this issue  because we've heard a lot of moralizing on the other side about this -- government spending and debt.
nonapplause Essentially  my proposal would change three things about the current health care system.
nonapplause Its leaders were men like Harry Truman and Senator Scoop Jackson and John F. Kennedy  men who understood the challenges of our times.
nonapplause That is the real threat to our future.
nonapplause Because it's not just a battle for the soul of the Republican Party  it's a battle for the soul of this nation and for my children's future.
nonapplause Indeed  when the authorization was being debated  the administration did in fact seek to have language inserted in it that would have authorized them to use military force domestically and the Congress refused to agree.
nonapplause And Vice President Mondale had lunch with the President every week  had defined responsibilities  could come to any meeting.
nonapplause You mentioned our efforts to build one America.
nonapplause We still face serious challenges in Afghanistan and Iraq.
nonapplause Yes we can.
nonapplause We are a generous people  a thoughtful people who hurt  and share the sadness when people lose their life or when people are hurt.
nonapplause From around the corner to around the world  you were the Chairman's personal inspector general when it came to how family are cared for.
nonapplause So we must be firm.
nonapplause And I promise you  you will never have another election where it will matter more.
nonapplause Never mind that 170 other countries already had family-leave laws  never mind that most of these countries actually provided paid family leave when a parent was sick or a baby was being born.
nonapplause When it comes to terrorism  time is a luxury we don't have.
nonapplause As a way to clarify the matter  Senator Kerry recently said  and again  quote: "I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."
nonapplause At the end of that time I hope that we shall have some of the answers to some of the problems to which Mrs. Townsend referred; namely  how teachers are prepared for teaching  to have a look at the three year certificate course and the one year post-graduate course and the Bachelor of Education degree  and any changes needed to make these more appropriate to the needs of students and schools.
nonapplause It's a showpiece for British engineering and our great construction companies and I would like to thank and congratulate them all on this magnificent achievement.
nonapplause And whenever I vote  we win.
nonapplause These reforms are going to prevent another crisis like we just saw  and protect all Americans  particularly our military families  from abusive consumer financial practices.
nonapplause They create seven out of every 10 new jobs in America -- our small businesses.
nonapplause Why does the pay limit not start until August 1st and how many bargains will be hustled through in the meantime.
nonapplause I'm immensely -- I'm so proud of her.
nonapplause We want peace!"
nonapplause He sees a day in which every day is tax day  April 15th.
nonapplause The flagship of this bold new policy is the Forum for the Future  an unprecedented international venue to amplify the voices of reform that are redefining the region.
nonapplause But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times.
nonapplause It's helped us to open a critical front on the ongoing battle against HIV/AIDS.
nonapplause When women make less than men for the same work  that hurts families who find themselves with less income and have to work harder just to get by.
nonapplause That is no longer the case.
nonapplause Let me say  this is a great time for this city and a great time for our nation.
nonapplause In that spirit it has been my view for twelve years now that Saddam Hussein must be removed from power if we're to have a more peaceful world and a more secure America.
nonapplause There were fears that the EU's efforts to come closer together would either fail or  succeeding  would fatally divide Europe and the United States.
nonapplause They killed campaign finance reform and lobby reform and the Superfund bill to clean up the toxic waste dumps.
nonapplause Here are the principles  I want to follow for meeting this challenge.
nonapplause And the follow-up -- one reason I wanted to do this summit so badly was that I thought we could find a completely nonpartisan way to embrace this issue  and then I knew I could trust Colin Powell and Ray Chambers and the others to do good follow-up.
nonapplause They now run all the ministries.
nonapplause In Asia itself  we continue to strengthen our partnership in support of peace.
nonapplause But what did Lincoln say?
nonapplause But what we can do is make sure that we are a stalwart partner  that we are working alongside them  that we are committed to their success  that in terms of training their security forces  training their civilian forces in order to achieve a more effective government  they know that they have a steady partner with us.
nonapplause Thirty-eight hundred strong  you've trained Iraqi soldiers and police  giving them the skills they need to defend their country and to protect their fellow citizens.
nonapplause It symbolizes the success of a new management style we are bringing to the government.
nonapplause And yet some of our opponents  those who dug in their heels and fought the hardest against what we were trying to do  are those who over the years have persisted in this system we've had of spending more than we take in.
nonapplause We're not done yet.
nonapplause And there always has been  which -- in the past  a basic bargain we had in this country  a bargain that has been  quite frankly  abrogated the last 15 or 20 years.
nonapplause It will make our grid more secure and more reliable  saving us some of the $150 billion we lose each year during power outages.
nonapplause The things they used to say about us in Texas so most people thought they could never vote for us aren't true anymore.
nonapplause Thank you and God bless you.
nonapplause I want to thank America Online  George Franberg of AOL is here  for providing more than $1 million in grants to help narrow the digital divide.
nonapplause I said  I want policies that basically look to the future  not to the past; that embrace change  not the status quo; that promote unity  not division -- we've got enough of that  goodness knows  in our country -- that give everybody a chance  not just a few people; and that promote us as leaders  not followers.
nonapplause We are going to stand in stark contrast to the Democrats  who for decades now have represented the politics of division setting race against race  and gender against gender  and group against group.
nonapplause And by the way  this stuff is not going to be easy.
nonapplause He's already promised  of course  to raise your taxes.
nonapplause And so there has to be a process for evaluating which ones ought to be re-licensed  and it needs to be a reasonable process if people are going to plan on continued use of that nuclear power in the future.
nonapplause Just before we took office  he said our economic program is obviously  murderously inflationary.
nonapplause The idea behind this  obviously  is that the government cannot do this alone  but business cannot be expected to go it alone.
nonapplause Now  what I would like to say not only to those of you in this room  where I suppose I'm preaching to the saved  as we say down home  but to all Americans  including those who are not in this room  is that this is something that is important that goes way beyond health care and way beyond money.
nonapplause When you look through his distinguished record of public service  you'll find many more.
nonapplause You know why it -- why that's so important.
nonapplause The last thing I want to say is this.
nonapplause But last year  reported crime fell 7 percent  and that's the steepest drop since 1960.
nonapplause Two weeks ago  tens of thousands of seniors who fall into the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the doughnut hole began receiving a $250 check to help them afford their medicine.
nonapplause It looks as if he's doing things.
nonapplause I think we ought to say  if we could create the future of our dreams for our kids  what will we do?
nonapplause Today I saw corn-based windshield wiper fluid  and something that I think is important  biodegradable  agriculturally-rooted golf tees.
nonapplause So much faith in the notion that the 21st century will lead once again.
nonapplause I know because I've seen it in cities across this country  where many of you that I had a chance to meet with  I saw how you focused on fresh ideas over stale ideology  and you moved your cities forward.
nonapplause Well  we decontrolled oil prices -- one of the first things we did -- and the price of gasoline went down 8 cents a gallon.
nonapplause You can't change them.
nonapplause As best we can tell  he didn't attend any meetings of the Senate intelligence committee for the year after that attack.
nonapplause In 1980 government was growing like toadstools after a rainstorm  spinning out of control like a washing machine that was out of cycle.
nonapplause As I said  this is a moment of opportunity.
nonapplause But student performance bears a close relationship to the way the money is spent.
nonapplause I am not sure we can govern ourselves because there's a big question mark today behind the capacity in principle of our people to take on this task.
nonapplause It takes folks like you  folks who are constantly rejecting the cynicism  casting aside the doubts  and working day after day to continue what we've already started.
nonapplause And we have done more to open the doors of college to all Americans than ever before.
nonapplause I honestly believe the great challenge of the next couple of decades will be to move the world from interdependence to integration  to defeat the forces of destruction and chaos.
nonapplause Policeman and fire fighters  people who wear our country's uniform  are reminding us what it means to sacrifice for something greater than yourself.
nonapplause I read one article that compared the emotional turmoil that the country had experienced after the attack to the turmoil that America felt so long ago when President Lincoln was assassinated.
nonapplause So the goal is to target communities at the center of the crisis  and to empower local agencies who know these communities best to structure and tailor their programs in ways that are most responsive.
nonapplause Please have a seat  everybody.
nonapplause Now here's the reason why that's a big deal.
nonapplause When the Coastal Family Health Center lost three buildings and more than 60 staff members  Hands On offered to help.
nonapplause That means deploying more boom  cleaning more beaches  performing more monitoring of wildlife and impact to this ecosystem.
nonapplause And today I just wanted all of you to know how delighted and grateful I am for that.
nonapplause Dr. DuBois  a towering African American intellectual  died here as a citizen of Ghana and a friend of Kwame Nkrumah.
nonapplause Toward this end  we have four basic objectives tonight.
nonapplause And here's the problem.
nonapplause We are on your side and we will see this through.
nonapplause Over the long term  we must do more to simplify the tax code as well.
nonapplause My last visit here was a little over a year ago  when I came to take part in a graduation ceremony for 114 -- the 114th class of the Columbus Police recruits.
nonapplause The idea that we can keep the American Dream alive  preserve our basic values and make the new future that all of you and your children deserve.
nonapplause It's only by remaking our schools for the 21st century that our children will get those good jobs so they can make of their lives what they will.
nonapplause Can I count on you to give me a hand?
nonapplause This is the good part of the speech.
nonapplause And tonight I had a chance to meet Beth as well  and it's great to see you.
nonapplause There are more than 1 million community gardens that are flourishing all around the country  and many of them are in under-served urban communities that are providing greater access to fresh produce for their neighbors.
nonapplause After all that has happened  does anyone doubt that what our country needs today is a change of direction  a fresh and kindling sense of purpose?
nonapplause That's an absolutely essential objective for the President and myself.
nonapplause They're needed.
nonapplause It's the spirit that so many of you have shown in Afghanistan and Iraq and all around the world  year after year  tour after tour.
nonapplause Their budget says in order to get a $250 billion tax cut and a seven-year balanced budget  we'll just take $450 billion out of the health care system over the next seven years.
nonapplause They're for an America coming together.
nonapplause See?
nonapplause So  from the bottom of my heart  on behalf of every one of those young men and women -- like you  and my son's outfit in Iraq -- serving the nation on the ground  in the air  at sea -- I say to all of you I admire you  the President admires you  and the nation is grateful for what you do.
nonapplause Not long after 9/11  one high-ranking al Qaeda official said  "This is the beginning of the end for America."
nonapplause And it's not something I or anyone in the administration take lightly.
nonapplause In a time in which we have to cut domestic spending  we have to find more money to spend on this.
nonapplause Indeed  that possible direction of savings in pension funds and insurance funds is something on which the Labour party have already officially agreed with the socialist politicians in the TUC.
nonapplause There's something almost patronizing in the opposition of some elements in the United States to China coming into the WTO  when the people they say they're trying to help believe they'll be helped if China does come into the WTO.
nonapplause We're rebuilding this economy not just in the short term but for the long term –- for our children  for our grandchildren  for our great-grandchildren.
nonapplause They answer no to all these -- no  no  no  no.
nonapplause And to you  Brant  many thanks  for having put up with all of my absences from home while you were growing up  all the many moves  all the missed soccer games  and despite that  having become the fine young man that you are.
nonapplause He is opposed to reform of our legal system  and he is against medical liability reform.
nonapplause And as he was in the taxi cab  which was driven by a colored taxi driver  the driver turned around and said  "Listen.
nonapplause Now  that is the background to what leads to the first announcement.
nonapplause Well  again  welcome.
nonapplause Your Rose Revolution will only be complete when government is transparent  accountable  and fully participatory; when issues are debated inside this chamber  not only out on the streets; when you fully address key constitutional issues regarding the balance of power between the parliament and the executive branch  and leveling your electoral playing field; when the media is totally independent and professional  providing people the information to make informed decisions  and to hold their government accountable for the decisions it makes; when the courts are free from outside influence and the rule of law is firmly established  and when the transfer of power occurs through peaceful  constitutional  and democratic processes  not on the street.
nonapplause And we've got a role  the government's got a role.
nonapplause And that's really what Mother's day is all about: showing our gratitude for all that they do.
nonapplause One young soldier  part of the 173rd Airborne that jumped into Iraq at the beginning of the war  wanted me to know how much he appreciated the President's decisive leadership.
nonapplause Some things matter more than others.
nonapplause A look at the district lines shows how corrupt the whole process has become.
nonapplause But whether it's -- whatever pans out of it  what it shows is that there is a magnificent world out there of things we still don't know.
nonapplause Number one  I think you really understand economics and you know that it's better to pay the debt down and keep interest rates down and keep capital available for a strong long-term economic recovery.
nonapplause Well  as I've said before  there really are only two things the liberals don't understand: the things that change  and the things that don't.

nonapplause And she was exceedingly jealous of me because I would get the copy three or four days before Sunday  and she got it a couple days later.

nonapplause It's a demonstrable success.
nonapplause Now  let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on.
nonapplause We came home and we shrunk up and we had the rise of the Ku Klux Klan; we had the rise of the Red Scare; and we walked away from the rest of the world and brought on an international economic collapse that gave rise to fascism and Nazism and brought the second world war.
nonapplause And if you don't elect her Senator  we'll take it away.
nonapplause But we can't even get an up and down vote in Congress.
nonapplause In 2003  President Bush announced the Preserve America Initiative  which encourages communities to safeguard their natural and historical treasures.
nonapplause That is the basic issue which is before us as Americans  and as believers in freedom  and it is the solution to this somewhat parochial situation that we must address our energy.
nonapplause These men are not putting their lives on the line to restore a dictatorship of the past; these men are fighting for freedom.
nonapplause I believe that Mr. Nixon  after the Republican Convention  had two alternatives: One  he could run on the facts  on a realization that this was a difficult and dangerous and promising time  that unless the United States was prepared to make a major effort both at home and abroad we could not hope to maintain our position as the leader of the free world; we could not hope to make the balance of power to shift in the direction of freedom.
nonapplause That's something I will be particularly proud of being a part of.
nonapplause We need to do a better job at making sure that our parents know what's best for their kids.

nonapplause The very important question today is whether  on five years' reflection  we have yet learned all the lessons of 9/11.
nonapplause So why is it that we go through the scripture  read all these passages  think they have something to do with us.

nonapplause We can do it -- you can do it if you demand that it be done.
nonapplause But we have to make the right decisions on the basic questions: Are we going to build on the prosperity or reverse course?
nonapplause I think maybe it's even part of the whole scheme of initiative of UNESCO  the dialogue of civilizations  which has as its basis the presentation of the other in humanized terms.
nonapplause It is whether we're going to continue to build one America  where every law-abiding citizen feels a part  an equal part  and feels that the government in Washington -- especially in the White House  but also in the Congress -- is on their side and even when I don't agree with you  I have a listening ear.

nonapplause I agree with the lady who wrote in a letter:
nonapplause Years ago  former President Ronald Reagan said in the Republican Party that there ought to be an 11th Commandment  "Speak no ill of another Republican."
nonapplause A few years ago  how many people would have predicted it could become independent?
nonapplause You just imagine you have an employee ID card every day when we fight for the minimum wage and we fight to save and reform Medicare and Social Security  and we fight for the education of our children; when we fight to let disabled people keep their Medicaid when they go to work  so they can go into the work force.
nonapplause And it forced us to adjust and to adapt to a whole new threat  because the most serious threat we face today  now  is the possibility of terrorists ending up in the middle of one of our cities with a deadlier weapon than we've ever seen before -- a chemical or a biological agent  or even a nuclear weapon.
nonapplause But those who believe must be free to speak of and act on their belief  to apply moral teaching to public questions.

nonapplause Though our Founding Fathers celebrated in our documents the universal rights of man as being inherent in human nature  we actually started out with a Constitution that stated that slaves were not fully citizens; and by the language of the Constitution  therefore  not fully human.

nonapplause You could not tell where he stood on that basic fundamental issue.

nonapplause America is proud that our citizens came here from every corner of the world to better themselves and to live in freedom.
nonapplause It is the kind of problem that is difficult of solution  but it is the kind of problem that the Republicans never think about.
nonapplause And as long as Vermont believes in the values that you hold today  strong rural values of community  where we truly believe that all of us are responsible to each other and all of us are responsible for each other  this state will continue to be a great and wonderful state and my job  that I've had for the last eleven and a half years  will continue to be the greatest job in Vermont.

nonapplause I'll never forget that special dream that started here in 1980.

nonapplause But the slither and slide which is... is the result of  I think  the most disastrous record of five years this country's had in the post-war period  has resulted in doubling of prices  and just remember when our opponents say that they have practically got inflation licked and it's just below 10%;  that 10%; today is 10%; of double the prices that existed when we Conservatives were in power and that's a lot more in pounds  in terms of pounds in your pocket.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech of Vice President Richard M. Nixon  Atlanta  Ga.
nonapplause As you go about your day tomorrow and you read the paper and you do-- You just think about how many times you read something and somebody says something's going to happen and you know it's going to happen  and it's going to happen not because the person talking said it  but because there's a whole organized effort of component  honest people and a system that works.

nonapplause Two-and-a-half years ago  there was a lot of talk about education reform  but there wasn't much action.
nonapplause I should point out that because virtually 100 percent of these families will be people on very modest incomes  they will be eligible also for the $1 500-a-year HOPE tax credit in the first two years of college  tax credits for the junior and senior year  expanded work-study programs  student loan programs -- a student loan program which in most places allows them to pay the loan back as a percentage of the income that they earn -- and the IRA that can be withdrawn from without penalty if the money's used to educate children -- most of that was the product of the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
nonapplause Slow down.
nonapplause It is a bid election  there are big differences and our party is the only party that wants you to know what the differences really are.

nonapplause In the course of the last thirty-odd years  we've turned our back on that one  though.
nonapplause That is the magnitude of change we are facing.

nonapplause And because the President and Congress acted without delay  the current downturn is far less likely to drag on.
nonapplause Let me just say the most important words I can say: thank you.
nonapplause That we say we cannot afford to pass up the chance of a lifetime  maybe the chance of a half a century  to build the future of our dreams for our children.
nonapplause This morning in Washington I ran a 5K race with a group of astonishingly able disabled Americans: two who raced in their chairs who had raced all over the world; one marathon runner who happened to be blind; one woman who had MS and made a terrific race around the 5K track -- kept the pace all the way; one amputee who had once run a 62-mile race in one day on a prosthesis  and today made the 5K around on his crutches just to prove he could do that  too.
nonapplause I know in this area companies are humming with activity  and unemployment is below the national average.
nonapplause So that's one concern  and another concern is some of them still have pretty tough liabilities on their books because a lot of them lent into commercial real estate or other loans that they're not sure are going to get repaid.
nonapplause That's what I believe.
nonapplause Garth Brooks said it's "honesty  sincerity  and real life to the hilt."
nonapplause We never were able to short him.
nonapplause And if we do  it will open up a whole new vista.
nonapplause Another way we can help them is by steering them away from risky behavior  and guiding them toward the knowledge and the self-respect they need to lead successful lives.
nonapplause So I'm very grateful to them.
nonapplause Indeed  I think in spite of our willingness at the moment  perhaps  to ignore it more than we ought  they called the 80's quite wrongly the decade of greed.
nonapplause And the southerner said  "No  I'm just going to stand here and wait until the police get here."
nonapplause How do we fill this hole faster?
nonapplause We're fighting the crusade for a drug free America on many fronts.
nonapplause And here  too  we find rising achievement scores and the attitudes necessary for success.
nonapplause Furthermore  there is $1 trillion Let me say that again.
nonapplause Seven million people have moved off welfare -- a 60-percent drop in the welfare rolls; 3.3 million children now have health insurance under the Children's Health Insurance Program.
nonapplause This is not about singling out individual nations -- it's about the responsibilities of all nations.
nonapplause In the State of the Union  I called on Americans to join in this national mission to make every child technologically literate  to connect every classroom and library in our country by the dawn of the 21st century  which is just a few years away  to connect them with quality computers  trained teachers  creative software.
nonapplause And I thank General Becton for pledging his support for this effort.
nonapplause And after a while  the rockets stayed on the ground  but then her musical career took off.
nonapplause It is very forward thinking on both the part of the World Bank and Indonesia but I hope that the other countries affected will do that and in its pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals  I hope that you  Mr. President and ECOSOC  can have an influence in urging this sort of project to be done in other countries outside the tsunami affected areas.
nonapplause There's been talk about having more centralized planning for our economy.
nonapplause In such a world  it's all too rare for a struggle to emerge that speaks to something universal about humanity.
nonapplause Here in Illinois  we convicted a man with a longstanding ties to bin Laden  who had been using a Chicago-area charity called the "Benevolence International Foundation" to channel money to Islamic militants.
nonapplause And we've been presented with some problems in this administration.
nonapplause Now  even with stronger standards  better assessments  outstanding teachers  some schools will still be difficult to turn around.
nonapplause It is central as the family is central  as the towns we live in are central  and as our churches are central.
nonapplause There are still millions of men and women who want to end their dependence on government and become independent through hard work.
nonapplause The clearest  most important difference in this campaign is simple to state: President Bush understands the war on terror and has a strategy for winning it; Senator Kerry does not.
nonapplause I thought it was pretty hot stuff to have a parade down the street.
nonapplause All Presidents of the United States have come to the National Prayer Breakfast  regardless of their religious views.
nonapplause We are about to build a supercomputer in partnership with IBM that will in one second do more calculations than you can go home and do on a hand-held calculator in 30 000 years.
nonapplause Being here  you join a long  unbroken line of service at Jacksonville -- from the naval aviators from World War II to Korea to Vietnam  among them a great patriot named John McCain.
nonapplause And likewise  I'm proud to be the President of a nation whose true strength are the hearts and souls of citizens from all walks of life.
nonapplause And it's also true that I wanted to see the school that some people are saying is just A - number one  top of the heap  king of the hill.
nonapplause One of those public servants  of course  is my friend Don Rumsfeld  who served Illinois in Congress for many years and then as a senior executive in the business community here in Chicago.
nonapplause So they continue committing acts of random horror  believing they can intimidate the civilized world and break the will of the American people.
nonapplause And he understands that we can't preserve peace by appeasing the Communist bloc; we must preserve peace by blocking communism.
nonapplause It gave us the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression  and it took us from record surpluses to record deficits.
nonapplause She has urged her fellow members of Congress to continue to act with fiscal restraint as they debate what to do with the budget surplus.
nonapplause If we can connect 20 percent of the schools in the largest state in the nation in less than a year  we can surely connect the rest of the country by the end of the decade.
nonapplause The restoration of those defences will be a first charge on the budget of any Government over which I preside.
nonapplause I believe once we know all the details of that attack in Jakarta yesterday  we'll find that it  too  was sponsored by an Indonesian organization that's affiliated with the al Qaeda organization.
nonapplause Even after a strike inside our own country -- the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in New York -- there was a tendency to treat terrorist attacks as individual criminal acts  to be handled primarily as a matter for law enforcement.
nonapplause In my 5 years in the White House  I've learned to depend on John for help and support and  often enough  guidance.
nonapplause It's a combination of strategy that involves not only going after the individuals who perpetrate terrorist attacks -- we've done that before.
nonapplause Bring a friend  if you have one."
nonapplause Now  has all this made a difference?
nonapplause Why is this health care issue so important to this agenda.
nonapplause What I appreciated about this meeting is that no matter what our region or our party  we've always gotten together and tried to pay serious attention to our problems.
nonapplause I'm not here today to dwell on our differences.
nonapplause Let's have more exchange programs between Arabs and Americans and others.” And again  on each one of those  we had people coming up and saying they would fund programs.
nonapplause And the women who work here are busy.
nonapplause The question facing the world at this very moment is not whether Saddam Hussein is moral  it is whether this nation will forfeit its moral authority by violating the U.N. Charter  the Geneva Conventions  and the U.S. Constitution by launching thousands of rockets against a broken people  destroying their lives  their families  their homes.
nonapplause Now they are as worried as the Liberals about losing their seats.
nonapplause He leads a party that voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties and votes 90 percent against $1.25 in 1960.
nonapplause I know that feeling.
nonapplause Not coincidentally the first audits of the massive sums flowing through the U.S. authorities in Iraq now show  not only with money appropriated by Congress  but also from the Iraqi oil revenues  that billions of dollars have disappeared with absolutely no record of where it went  to whom  for what  or when.
nonapplause It is a beautiful and powerful symbol of where many people stand today in this great land.
nonapplause We have the opportunity.
nonapplause Nancy sponsored the Invest in America Act  legislation that provides tax incentives to companies that conduct their research and development -- and create jobs -- here in the United States.
nonapplause I didn't know it had been built in Ireland.
nonapplause So the Chesapeake Machine Company is a perfect example.
nonapplause Mr. Arnold.
nonapplause I can see our Scandinavian colleagues looking very cheerful at that prospect!
nonapplause The next point I want to make is there's a lot of good news in health care.

nonapplause Law is passed by our represented legislatures.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at the Teacher of the Year Award Ceremony
nonapplause He said  "If I weren't President  I'd be buying stocks right now."
nonapplause Well  the economic vitality that's so apparent in our country today is not the product of blind luck; it's the result of good policies -- and policies that many of you helped shepherd through the system.
nonapplause And we went into a home of a 70-year-old couple who had been married for  I don't know  nearly 50 years.
nonapplause Charge it to my head and not to my heart.
nonapplause We're for a patients' bill of rights and they're not.
nonapplause Another point that I should make.
nonapplause And one other thing I'm especially proud of: After 6 years of this administration  not 1 square inch of territory in the world has been lost to communism  and one small country  Grenada  has been freed from communist tyranny.
nonapplause We've made community college virtually free to nearly everybody in this country now with tax credits called the HOPE Scholarship.
nonapplause A national baseball announcer here to call opening day.
nonapplause And then make it voluntarily available to every state and school district.
nonapplause This depends in part on a strong America.
nonapplause The gift of humor can make a people see what they might ordinarily overlook and it supplements that other gift of great leaders  vision.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks Congratulating the World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers
nonapplause I was looking for a way to reach out into my neighborhood and my community and pull somebody else along with me  because I thought  there but for the grace of God go I. I know I could be in a different situation from somebody else.
nonapplause And the biggest threat that this President  and future Presidents  must worry about is weapons of mass destruction getting in the hands of a terrorist network that would like to do us harm.
nonapplause And you know what that means: That could threaten our prosperity.
nonapplause Trent began his political career as an administrative aide to Democratic Congressman William Colmer  a fine man who ably represented his State for many years.
nonapplause Energy prices are declining.
nonapplause On the continent of Africa  this great nation is committed to bringing the healing power of medicine to millions of men and women and children now suffering with AIDS.
nonapplause Before I bring somebody else up here to the microphone  I had the honor of going to Walter Reed the other day to thank our soldiers.
nonapplause I came here to San Francisco today to issue a challenge to America to see to it that every classroom in our country -- every classroom in our country is connected to the Information Superhighway.
nonapplause Indeed  many of the principles that we recognize as so important in the 21st century -- speed  jointness  flexibility  transformation  precision -- were  in a sense  pioneered by Jimmy Doolittle.
nonapplause So you will  I know  understand why I shall not be able to be here as much as I would wish to be.
nonapplause So we thank Safeway.
nonapplause Your Royal Highness  some people fear scientific and technological change but our only fear should be that our competitors will use it faster than we do.
nonapplause So if you think about where we are here as a country  I am profoundly grateful for the results which have been achieved.
nonapplause This great nation is stepping forward to help.
nonapplause Inspectors were sent to Iraq not to determine whether Saddam has weapons of mass destruction  but simply to confirm that Iraq truly was disarming itself -- as required by U.N. Security Council resolutions.
nonapplause But very often  when things are going well  people get distracted or do what seems easiest and most at hand.
nonapplause First of all  there does have to be a security strategy  because there are people who want to derail the whole thing  to prevent and punish those who believe that they can find their redemption in our destruction.
nonapplause May we continue to live up to the ideals for which both Andrew Jackson Smith and Theodore Roosevelt risked their lives.
nonapplause We were on the edge of an economic abyss.
nonapplause I just like to remind everybody what you say is being recorded.
nonapplause She has been called the Iron Lady—irrepressible  at times incorrigible  always indomitable.

nonapplause Those are the reforms that we are now making.
nonapplause This is not a partisan issue; this is a special interest issue.
nonapplause We must and we will use every means at our disposal to ensure the freedom and security of the American people.
nonapplause This is not some idle theory.
nonapplause George and I have seen first hand the good and generous hearts of the American people.
nonapplause We have destroyed their land and their crops.
nonapplause I think that would be a terrible mistake because it -- it again  it does all the things that I think we should be doing.

nonapplause Be open to new ideas.
nonapplause —By how much did Labour cut the pay of the nurses?
nonapplause Words can't express my appreciation to each and every one of you  whether you've been on the team for 7 months or 7 years  for the contribution that you're making.

nonapplause Well  this has been a week of champions for me.
nonapplause She was my second and 3rd grade teacher.
nonapplause And that means the federal employees did their job.
nonapplause But I must say that it's hard to picture the United States House of Representatives without the presence of this brilliant  gracious  good-hearted man.
nonapplause Our accomplishments these past four years demonstrate something about the character of our President.
nonapplause Everybody thinks that's unfair.
nonapplause At the same time  I think it's important that we acknowledge that trade alone cannot lift nations from poverty.
nonapplause Our police must be strengthened and our magistrates given back adequate powers to deal effectively with young offenders.
nonapplause Two centuries ago at another time of great challenge and change  a group of Revolutionary War veterans were given this piece of land in an unchartered wilderness.
nonapplause A couple of days ago I flew out to Washington and Oregon  and I'm sure you've seen on the television the absolutely horrible floods they have been enduring.
nonapplause And  where are you?
nonapplause Chicago has a "no social promotion" policy  but if you fail they don't just say you're a failure.
nonapplause I believe the United States  in order to make sure our people have got a standard of living that improves  must be a leader in the world  must not fear competition  must be willing to continue to put policies in place that will mean that other generations of Americans coming up can realize a great quality of life.
nonapplause Today if you drive down a street in the typical American neighborhood  you'll find more people at work than ever before in our history.
nonapplause The rise of Russia as a world-wide naval power  threatens our oil rigs and our traditional life-lines  the sea routes.
nonapplause I asked Governor Florio through the Trade Ambassador  Mickey Kantor  to serve on our intergovernmental advisory committee  because there's so much relationship now between our national trade policies and the policies followed at the state and local level for growth.
nonapplause In 2004  President Bush beat John Kerry  78 to 21.
nonapplause And I think the decision we're going to make on November 2nd goes right smack at that issue  and that there is a fairly clear choice in terms of the way we will pursue that objective and the way President Bush will continue to pursue that objective  and I think the way John Kerry and John Edwards would go about it.
nonapplause And I thank you  Mr. President  and I thank you  too  Mr. Vice President  for all that you have done these past four years to keep America's Armed Forces the very best in the world  and for all your concern for the safety of our men and women and for their welfare and for the welfare of their families.
nonapplause I mean  there's a set of rules and people follow them.
nonapplause We have a lot to learn from on another.
nonapplause I propose a new Energy Security and Environment Trust which will speak the development of cleaner  more fuel-efficient cars and products  modernize aging power systems  and bring people more choice and more competition from clean cars that get 80 miles to the gallon to targeted tax cuts that help people afford more energy-efficient homes and appliances.
nonapplause And you see that repeated over and over and over throughout the country.
nonapplause Well  look back over time where that's gotten us.
nonapplause Or 1988  December  when they blew Pan Am 103 out of the skies over Lockerbie  Scotland?
nonapplause There's a clear difference  a very clear difference.
nonapplause We have eliminated 2 200 various publications  bulletins  and reports and so forth  such as "How to Buy a Christmas Tree."
nonapplause And so to all the men who have served this country and the Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate  to all of those who serve in positions of trust like this and who serve honorably as Dean Taylor has  who work in the interests of their constituents as he has  who puts the Nation first (even when it may cost him politically) as he has  to all of them I say the Nation is grateful tonight.
nonapplause It must be the calling and cause of every American.
nonapplause Remember what we saw on the morning of 9/11  and knowing the nature of these enemies  we have as clear a responsibility as could ever fall to government: we must do everything in our power to keep terrorists from ever acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
nonapplause So I can see why General Eisenhower got lost.
nonapplause Or maybe it was 1993  the first bombing of the World Trade Center in New York?
nonapplause At the next election a vote for Callaghan and what he pretends to stand for is a vote for Benn and what he really stands for.
nonapplause If you find somebody who's shut-in  just spend a little time.
nonapplause There aren't new benefits being added  so there will be a couple of percent growth in population between now and 1998.
nonapplause Senator Kerry is now trying to re-create himself as an entrepreneurial Democrat.
nonapplause I see the storm coming and I know His hand and is in it  but  if He has a place and a part for me  I believe that I am ready."
nonapplause And I take this commandment to heart.
nonapplause Because out there where people live  crime and preventing it is a bipartisan issue.
nonapplause And finally let me say we have to have a community approach to the future.
nonapplause But the point is  we were right when we made our good turn in 1980.
nonapplause You didn't have to do this tonight  and we're very grateful to you.

nonapplause But we've come a long way already by being strong  steady  and determined.
nonapplause You know   every time I have a fight with the NRA they say  guns don't kill people  people do.
nonapplause You need to think about this in terms of what you do between now and the election for senator and congressman.
nonapplause Shorter than health care  right?
nonapplause To accomplish this  we've put in motion one of the most aggressive campaigns against waste and fraud in the history of the Defense Department  aggressively following up on every lead.
nonapplause Finally  on this point  I think that it is important that we support President Megawati in Indonesia  as she attempts to navigate the perilous waters in which she finds herself.
nonapplause And second  we have concluded an agreement regarding social security benefits between those of our citizens who combine work in both nations.
nonapplause This election is not like 1992 when the issue was change against status quo.
nonapplause So  I propose that we lift our sights toward a second challenge for America: By this time next year we must have passed enterprise zones  passed the youth opportunity wage  found ways to simplify the tax system  and all of us must go forward to make this expansion so strong that millions of jobs will be created in distressed areas where our fellow citizens need help the most.
nonapplause Mr. Chairman  some anniversaries are private.
nonapplause But you guys didn't stop.
nonapplause There is now evidence.
nonapplause The choices are painful and agonizing  but they have to be made.
nonapplause Probably the most convincing proof that we have a solid economic recovery  though  is that those same critics aren't calling it Reaganomics anymore.
nonapplause We immediately set up command center operations here in the Gulf and coordinated with all state and local governments.
nonapplause It'll be another step toward the political realignment that's been going on for a few years now and that needs an extra push from your wonderful State.
nonapplause Now  I don't know if any of you have every tried to hold a jackhammer where it was supposed to go  but it's not easy on a good day if you're big  strapping  strong and know what you're doing.
nonapplause Because while this bill bears her name  Lilly knows that this story isn't just about her.

nonapplause In fact  what they plan for the Navy is so bad that by the time they get through Michael may have to row the boat ashore!
nonapplause When I signed our tax reform legislation into law  I noted that the last 20 years had witnessed an expansion of many of our civil liberties  but that our economic liberties had been too often neglected  even abused.

nonapplause And as Senator Schumer said  this has never been done before.

nonapplause I'd vote for Hillary.
nonapplause We have uncovered a sophisticated  large-scale network selling nuclear weapons technologies on the black market -- and we have shut that network down.
nonapplause How do you deter a terrorist who is committed to jihad  whose basic aim in life is to kill infidels  especially Americans  who has no piece of real estate anyplace that he values that you can hold at risk in order to deter him from an attack against the United States?
nonapplause We want your help in this campaign.
nonapplause And so they continued to wage attacks against America and American interests around the globe.
nonapplause American agriculture is incredibly important for our economic vitality.
nonapplause Patriotism is proven in our concern for others -- a willingness to sacrifice for people we may never have met or seen.

nonapplause It has stoked great passions among the American people and their representatives.
nonapplause I mean  today we enjoy unmatched influence  with peace and freedom ascendant in the world  with enormous prosperity  enormous technical advances.
nonapplause And that breeds cynicism and disrespect for the law.
nonapplause I'll never forget.
nonapplause But months ago -- months ago -- I promised to be in New York City before I can get there  to talk about what we can do to give health care to the Americans who don't have it.

nonapplause We took office determined to change that.
nonapplause No grounds whatsoever.
nonapplause I also want to tell you that I'm going to do the best I can in this upcoming stimulus and economic package to do what I said I would do -- to bring down the deficit but to increase investment at the same time in ways that will make available more funds for the cities.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to Commemorate Veterans Day at Arlington National Cemetery

nonapplause Now  if you want growth without inflation you have to keep your markets open so there is some pressure on keeping the prices down.

nonapplause Maybe she's missing the point."
nonapplause And they would be right if there were any proof that the unborn are not living human beings.
nonapplause The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming.
nonapplause We can't have it both ways.
nonapplause That's why I want to congratulate this team –- for winning the World Series  and for showing every young person what it means to be a true professional.
nonapplause We've gotten to eat the desserts from the last State Dinner before anybody else.
nonapplause And I was walking down the street all by myself  and the band had turned the corner.
nonapplause In other words the inspections were working even when he was trying to thwart them.
nonapplause Knowing these things  how could we  I ask  have allowed that threat to stand?
nonapplause finest props of the duties of men and citizens.
nonapplause Do the Iraqi people really want to live together in peace and freedom  the peace and freedom for which our troops have sacrificed so much.
nonapplause We expect others to do theirs.
nonapplause This is a balanced bill.
nonapplause None of our triumphs -- not even one -- would have happened if George Bush's opponent had had his way.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause And I don't know why I brought that up  because they had to beat out the Cardinals to do it.
nonapplause We're now paying more than $100 billion in interest on that debt  and that's more than the whole Federal budget of just 20 years ago.
nonapplause I recognized a couple of judges among them.
nonapplause And so these aren't just statistics.
nonapplause It requires both a commitment to putting the police back on the street and in the neighborhoods  and a commitment from citizens to win the war against crime.
nonapplause Well  I think it has to do also with what should not exist  a kind of instinctive opposition of culture to politics.
nonapplause I know  because I'm not saying these things.
nonapplause But this exhibition helps to tell a fuller story -- that for all the challenges and superstitions men and women faced 1000 years ago  they still have the daring and enterprise to look beyond the horizon  to begin to build a world that measured up to their imagination.
nonapplause They count on the government to defeat those who are trying to destroy us  and we will.
nonapplause I tell people we got married because Dwight Eisenhower got elected President of the United States.
nonapplause Someone has shared with me excerpts from a young man's first letter home from training last summer.
nonapplause I'm thrilled that my wife has traveled with me today.
nonapplause For those folks  it was really hard to be Christian  and yet in a way it was easier for them to have faith--where for us  we live in a land in which any time we want we could get together.
nonapplause When we see a freely elected government in the Republic of Korea; battlefield victories for the Angolan freedom fighters; China opening and liberalizing its economy; democracy ascending in Latin America  the Philippines  and on every other continent -- where these and other indicators are strong  so too is America and so too are our hopes for the future.
nonapplause He was a great politician  and unemployment was 25 percent in America and the per capita income of Arkansas  Louisiana  and Mississippi was only about half the national average.
nonapplause Our families fall to pieces  and the peace of our streets falls to pieces  and our schools and class rooms begin to fall to pieces under the shadow of fear and violence.
nonapplause And in East Asia  North Korea poses a genuine nuclear threat  while we have begun to strip American forces from that peninsula to relieve the over-burdened forces in Iraq.
nonapplause You know  I just came back from the Far East  had a great trip representing our country there.
nonapplause None of them will disclose who's paying for these ads.
nonapplause I am glad I was given the chance to serve now.
nonapplause I had a print of Sir Winston in my private office; a wonderful picture with a a mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb in the background  and a gripping quote about the fears he had if the world was not wise enough to manage the nuclear age.
nonapplause And many kids don't have any access to physical education in the schools -- and that's also something that's also changed.
nonapplause On his own initiative he left his platoon  accompanied by one man  a comrade  and moved forward to do battle.
nonapplause We packed bags of food for folks in need.
nonapplause I'm honored to be here this morning.
nonapplause Now there's more than one thing going on here.
nonapplause It's like the time Abraham Lincoln found his entire Cabinet  with the exception of one member  ranged against him on an issue.
nonapplause And what I'd like to do today -- and I worked hard on this so I'm not going to do what Jim Harman said I did before -- I'm actually going to read some of this talk.
nonapplause This isn't just about safes and locks  it's about designing operations that minimize the possibility of a security breakdown.
nonapplause They told me I was wrong.
nonapplause Sometimes you'll hear people say that moral truth is relative  or call religious faith a comforting illusion.
nonapplause This ideology rejects tolerance  denies freedom of conscience  and demands that women be pushed to the margins of society.
nonapplause Now  the task is not complete.
nonapplause I tried to make it a genuine educational institution and not just a personal shrine to the eight years that my team and I did our best for America.
nonapplause And most employers raise doubts about the qualifications of future employees  rating high school graduates' basic skills as only "fair" or "poor."
nonapplause And I want to thank Commander Bock for his leadership of this great organization.
nonapplause They were reaching down  and they said  he's our guy.
nonapplause We have the truth and they don't.
nonapplause It's dangerous.
nonapplause I don't know how many times I've heard her say something or seen something she's written and thought  gosh  I wish I had thought of that.
nonapplause The economic enemies of democracy are those who would impose on people systems of production and distribution based on compulsion  not on people's choice.
nonapplause And now it's time to do the people's business.
nonapplause And that's why  whenever possible  my administration will make all information available to the American people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.
nonapplause I hadn't thought about it  but you've talked me into it.
nonapplause It was part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
nonapplause The really good teachers know how to script confidence and success onto the blank pages.
nonapplause And I want to thank all of you here tonight for supporting the work of IRI.
nonapplause Over time  they came to believe that they could strike America without paying a price -- because they did so many times in the 1980s and '90s.
nonapplause This is a time of great opportunity for the Western Hemisphere.
nonapplause The time has come to prove that we can make savings.
nonapplause And for many who lived through those harrowing days five years ago  there's searing memories that time may not erase.
nonapplause You've been hearing about them  right?
nonapplause And don't stop thinking about tomorrow.
nonapplause I know to people in some nations open trade seems at odds with these basic human goals  but I think the opposite is true.
nonapplause So the worst of the storm has passed.
nonapplause So if you know people who have access to these benefits  they should understand that these farmers' markets are there for them as well.
nonapplause Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone.
nonapplause It's a challenge any time two leaders from major powers get together.
nonapplause We're becoming increasingly diverse and different.
nonapplause But that's what he's been doing in Congress for the last 8 years.
nonapplause You get a raise today.
nonapplause The question has always been  how do we provide for that full use of our facilities?
nonapplause But there was no clear clearinghouse to collect the information and to get it to the decision-makers.
nonapplause We are not the cause of all the ills of the world.
nonapplause Because we cover medicine for Medicaid patients  but if you're a senior citizen on Medicare -- just a little bit too much income to be on Medicare --caid -- Medicaid  you can't get any help with your medicine.
nonapplause And if you put that against an inability to open more markets  to have more investment  to have more deregulation  to have more market access  it will create in our country the potential for a retrenchment here in a way that will not be good for Asia or Japan or for the United States over the long run.
nonapplause But in order to do it  we have to be quite clear not on saying our opponents are bad folks  but saying we have honest differences.
nonapplause And they cranked out  as I say by one estimate  at least 20 000 terrorists -- various places around the world  who came and were imbued in this ideology  were training in all of the various deadly arts they needed in terms of bomb-making and so forth  and then sent back into the society at large.
nonapplause And yet despite all of this  despite the bitterness of the past  despite the difficulties of the present  despite the uncertainty of the future  Dr. King held fast to his dream.
nonapplause Some of his harshest critics when he was living as President in the White House assailed him because they said there was too much laughter and he was too prone to joke.
nonapplause Our approach was right and they were not and that's why we got a budget agreement today that will enable us to balance the budget.
nonapplause And that victory can be celebrated by all who love freedom.
nonapplause And that's why I have issued this challenge to our nation to form a national partnership to make sure every young American has access to the future through the Information Superhighway.
nonapplause That is why we are given tongues.
nonapplause He made it up  I think.
nonapplause You work toward the cause of surrender  because in dealing with a Communist leader  any dictator  whenever you engage in activities which prove you to be naive  or whenever you make concessions that are not  at the same time  matched by concessions on their part  the inevitable result is that they are not satisfied.
nonapplause And so Tina Turner goes up to the microphone  everybody cheers like crazy  and she said  "You know I've been singing this song for 25 years  but it gets better every time I do it."
nonapplause And then  when I saw today in the paper that there were two people who put their lives on the line to help that poor guy at the teller machine last night in New York  I thought  that's what this country's all about.
nonapplause Even slightly more diverse than the Los Angeles county schools  unbelievably enough.
nonapplause Well  I found out that it's not so much that Mr. Mondale has a poor memory of his ruinous past; he's just got a darn good "forgetory."
nonapplause In this action  you have done an enormous amount to reassure and improve the lives of your fellow Americans.
nonapplause And recognizing that these ideas are not just good for Virginia or New Hampshire  they're important for all America.
nonapplause Education is a big issue.
nonapplause They're going to run up your taxes  but they're going to find new ways to spend the money and not solve the deficit.
nonapplause And I am grateful for the support I have received to put more police on the street  to have more summer school and after-school programs for young people  and to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals -- banning the cop-killer bullets  the assault weapons ban  the Brady Bill -- which has kept half a million felons  fugitives and stalkers from getting handguns.
nonapplause "Well " he said  "the plumber's coming in the morning."
nonapplause But my opponent says that's not part of the liberal agenda.
nonapplause Yes  China is still a one-party state  restricting rights of free speech and religious expression  doing things from time to time that frustrate us and even anger us.
nonapplause Thank you for the musical greeting.
nonapplause Well  if George Bush wants to make national security the central issue of the campaign of 2004  I have three words for him that I know he understands: Bring it on.
nonapplause Coming to a new country without a word of English  she and her husband Ramon worked as laborers.
nonapplause So instead  she and another widow started “Beyond the 11th ” and this is a group that empowers Afghan widows affected by war and terrorism.
nonapplause I will play fair and strive to win.
nonapplause The United States and Turkey can help the Palestinians and Israelis make this journey.
nonapplause And that in and of itself is a hard thing to even imagine.
nonapplause But we're going to have to do this together.
nonapplause Yes  I want to see more being done on research and development.
nonapplause You had a group of folks who drove the economy  drove the country  drove our car into the ditch.
nonapplause We're still going to have a very  very difficult circumstance in our country -- and most of our countries -- even when the GDP begins to grow again  as it hasn't in our country.
nonapplause I can do no less.
nonapplause Thank you all very much.
nonapplause I was just in Oregon  and if you've watched my speeches over time  you know I'm not much given to anecdotes in my speeches.
nonapplause Yet we continue to hear this attitude in arguments in our own country so often and so conveniently  it amounts to a policy of doing exactly nothing.
nonapplause Obesity's going through the roof and it's one reason I'm working on Childhood Obesity Initiative with the American Heart Association.
nonapplause There are some people we can't convert.
nonapplause I hate it  every time I think about it  but I am.
nonapplause The one on your wrists and ankles has to stay though."
nonapplause Matter of fact  I'll have an announcement tomorrow on this score.
nonapplause If you're a small business owner and you weren't aware of some of the programs that have been put in place or haven't participated  then  again  the White House website will connect you to the resources you need.
nonapplause We have really worked hard to reach out to literally to thousands and thousands of people in this great medical drama that unfolds in America every day.
nonapplause Again  I say  in many ways we're following your lead.
nonapplause Well  we look at them as individuals to be fulfilled through their own freedom and creativity.
nonapplause And if you've been there  you know what a beautiful place it is.
nonapplause Finally  let me say that if you look at the numbers  a million people sounds like a huge amount over four years  but in an American economy that has well over 100 million people in the work force  that produced 12 million new jobs in the last four years  with these extra incentives around the edges  with committed private sector employers -- small  medium  and large businesses -- this is not a problem.
nonapplause It's my way of doing a couple of things.
nonapplause I also want to say a special word of thanks to the members of Congress who were out there early on this  when there was some considerable political risk either attached to it  or thought to be attached.
nonapplause Most of us have seen the replicas  and I doubt any of us would want to spend a day in those conditions  much less the months it would take to make that crossing.
nonapplause We should be grateful for this tradition; we should work hard to maintain it.
nonapplause The new Mondale praises American technological achievement.
nonapplause Tell me  is it possible to get through a public address today in Britain without making reference to him?
nonapplause What do I have to pay them?
nonapplause President Ronald Reagan in his farewell address made the following observation about the United States of America which still rings true  particularly here in New Hampshire.
nonapplause This scourge has no respect for borders  none.
nonapplause And our new strategy has a clear mission and defined goals: to disrupt  dismantle  and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies.
nonapplause It's one of the few genres of music that can inspire the same passion in an eight-year-old that it can an 80-year-old –- and make them both want to get up and dance.
nonapplause Well  can I just tell you something?
nonapplause Joy understands that America faces challenges too important to be reduced to simple politics.
nonapplause Thank you all.
nonapplause Just this weekend  the Republican leader in the Senate said -- this is a quote from the Republican leader in the Senate -- “I wish we had been able to obstruct more.” Obstruct more?
nonapplause There's also a crowd in Washington who  as usual  is suggesting that the easy way to reduce deficit spending is to slash the defense budget.
nonapplause And he said that knowing he had just a little bit of time left.
nonapplause And there is a reason that we should have great confidence in their ability to do that.
nonapplause But our opponents' rhetoric of gloom and doom is nothing but a nightmare.
nonapplause Was it a nuisance four years ago  when the USS Cole was attacked and we lost 17 of our sailors and nearly lost the ship?
nonapplause They are much more cautious when it comes to cutting other types of public expenditure.
nonapplause And the overall economy would be worse off  and we wouldn't have any money to do these things.
nonapplause It is the work of men who somehow find a form of work that brings a security for its own sake and a state of society where want is abolished.
nonapplause But the Conservative Government in Britain has more than protected the retirement pension against rising prices.
nonapplause The purpose is obvious: If people inside the United States are communicating with al Qaeda  they are talking to the enemy  and we need to know about it.
nonapplause We have for centuries strived to live up to our founding ideal  of a nation where all are free and equal and able to pursue their own version of happiness.
nonapplause I always thought that the fact that both of them died on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence was the best evidence the modern world has on the question of whether God is.
nonapplause I'm sure you've noticed that our opponents  at the convention at least  and certainly afterward  don't seem to want to talk about policy at all.
nonapplause You couldn't decided on prices  Oh no  that was decided by Government.
nonapplause It would be illiberal in the extreme to think that disagreeing with a people's free choice means that we should deny them the freedom to choose altogether.
nonapplause But we built up another consensus after John Kennedy was assassinated  and it came apart again over our differences over the Vietnam War  civil rights  the rise of women  Roe v. Wade  and a lot of other cultural issues.
nonapplause So I honor all of you for the effort  and hope that you can  if not today but tomorrow and in the coming weeks  pat yourselves on the back for the work that you've been doing  because we're going to need you to do even more.
nonapplause The farmers of this country are the best market for Detroit  and the automobile industry.
nonapplause But there was no general agreement on how a stronger Federal Government should be constituted -- or  indeed  whether one should be constituted at all.
nonapplause In one of those elections  we won one state and the District of Columbia as I remember.
nonapplause And in doing this  you've become part of a movement that has literally swept this country  the movement against drinking and driving.
nonapplause And though great evils would linger  the world would never be the same after July 4  1776.
nonapplause Thank you for the opportunity.
nonapplause And no one who heard that speech will ever forget the vivid image of his mother crossing the creek with the rocks in her hand.
nonapplause That was a remarkable statement  and the Vice President gave you a remarkable introduction.
nonapplause This kid said  "Are you the real President?"
nonapplause So  yes  the Coast Guard's concerns are the Moscow agenda.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech at Cleveland State University in Ohio
nonapplause Borders don't count for much or stop much  good or bad  anymore.
nonapplause Running a successful small business is impressive in any year -- but it's especially impressive this year  at this moment when we're facing the most serious economic downturn in generations.
nonapplause Potentially  it could affect our allies  Greece and Turkey.
nonapplause I thank all of those who have come today.
nonapplause And I owe so much to this city and to this state.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to Members of the Summit Community  Host Officials  and Officials from Florida on the Goals of the Summit
nonapplause But this program isn't just about doing fun stuff together.
nonapplause In 1992  I told the American people I would focus on the economy like a laser beam.
nonapplause So  when we say no to drugs  it'll be clear that we mean absolutely none  no exceptions.
nonapplause But we do need to find ways to make certain we know who's here and what they're doing  and to protect it.
nonapplause I hope that will be apparent here.
nonapplause In the midst of all these challenges  however  my single most important responsibility as President is to keep the American people safe.
nonapplause This is an issue for the people who have health insurance and don't understand what it is that could be happening in -- almost certainly will happen in the years ahead  unless we get a handle on it.
nonapplause Too many small businesses can't insure their employees.
nonapplause ... come alive  come alive.
nonapplause Well  actually  dropped out isn't quite accurate.
nonapplause The other thing that has to happen in Afghanistan is that they've got to have security forces trained and equipped  and stood up capable of taking on the responsibilities for securing their own country.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause He was allowed to leave the chair  go down into the well and participate in the debates of the day.
nonapplause This was the message of another President  John F. Kennedy  when he visited Fort Stewart in 1962  and spoke to the troops on Donovan Field.
nonapplause I know this sounds simple  but why don't we figure out what we've got to do for Social Security and Medicare?
nonapplause And in this period of such great challenge for the country  we are reminded again that freedom comes at a price  and that a great nation must honor the men and women who have paid that price.
nonapplause I was the governor of one of your neighboring states.
nonapplause It wasn't very complicated.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a Spirit of America Rally in Atlanta  Georgia
nonapplause Because we're the only country in the advanced world that doesn't provide a basic package of health care to all of its citizens.
nonapplause In December  after nine months of intensive diplomacy  Colonel Ghadafi voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs.
nonapplause Because it simply means they couldn't escape each other.
nonapplause I could watch CNN.
nonapplause But the investigator in me was looking for a common thread that linked all good teachers.
nonapplause It must be you  deciding to take your place on the frontlines of this battle of the heart.
nonapplause And C  we got a court case in South Africa last year that said the drug companies would negotiate lower prices with countries.
nonapplause But not for enough Americans.
nonapplause Just as we do for natural disasters  we have to have plans and resources in place beforehand -- sharing information  issuing warnings and ensuring a coordinated response.
nonapplause Sit down  please.
nonapplause And to cite just one example of this region's extraordinary potential  in the next decade alone  East Asia plans to spend $1 trillion United States dollars on infrastructure projects alone.
nonapplause You're with us today  and the President and I are enormously grateful to each and every one of you.
nonapplause I think there should be continued efforts and internal reform and progress subject to attract evermore investment and make the most of the WTO system.
nonapplause I've asked Congress for tax incentives for companies that donate computers for technology training for every single new teacher in this country  and for funding to establish 1 000 community technology centers so that adults can also have access to the information economy.
nonapplause So we were able  being a Government with a clear majority  to say quite quickly  "The tyrant shall not have his way.
nonapplause And these terrorists brought terrible grief to our people and the attacks were clearly a shock to the economy.
nonapplause Now  speak up loudly so everyone can hear.
nonapplause Some in the press  in particular The New York Times  have made the job of defending against further terrorist attacks more difficult by insisting on publishing detailed information about vital national security programs.
nonapplause It's great to know when I look over my shoulder that the folks back home are with me.
nonapplause We will do so through our close friendship with Japan -- which will always be a centerpiece of our efforts in the region.
nonapplause What single issue could say more about a society's values than the degree of respect shown for human life at its most vulnerable: human life still unborn?
nonapplause That was the high water mark of America's investment in research and development.
nonapplause And then  before we knew it  there were riots in the streets  even here.
nonapplause I'm interested in building a consensus so that we can say we have done our duty for a younger generation of Americans coming up.
nonapplause As the President said in the State of the Union  "We are in this fight to win  and we are winning."
nonapplause That's how they stay in.
nonapplause We are not of the tradition  they say  of Wilson and Jefferson and Jackson.
nonapplause We must make it stronger.
nonapplause Eating the right things.
nonapplause Now  it is logical - I'm sure you can see why everybody feels this way  all the way from Hawaii in the very Far West to Maine  in the very North  or down East  as they say in Maine.
nonapplause I get that.
nonapplause I should also tell you that we're now going to have 40 of the empowerment zones that we had -- not that many  but we had 20 to 30 -- and we're going to have 40 other communities  enterprise communities  designed by the Republican members of Congress.
nonapplause We have a shared commitment to our environment that improves the quality of the air we breath and the water we drink.
nonapplause What more fitting place could there be to sign this treaty  which takes those associations forward into the 21st Century?
nonapplause We must rebuild business confidence and market confidence and consumer confidence through a permanently improved business environment.
nonapplause You've seen both.
nonapplause Ask what you have done.
nonapplause And I'm determined to see that those who still are not sharing fully in our nation's prosperity do so.
nonapplause So when I became First Lady  we started planting a garden and doing some things around healthy eating  but it led to the launch of a broader conversation  a campaign called “Let's Move!” And “Let's Move!” has a simple goal: We're trying to end childhood obesity in a generation so that kids born today grow up healthier and able to pursue their dreams.
nonapplause It's that simple.
nonapplause I ask your help in this campaign.
nonapplause This is not an accident.
nonapplause But our current economic crisis has only heightened the urgency of our health care challenge.
nonapplause Imagine an abandoned ghetto with people working again in shops and firms and restaurants.
nonapplause Ever since I ran for President in 1992  I've had a vision of making our nation a place where everyone -- everyone -- responsible enough to work for it could have a share of the American Dream.
nonapplause And I know who you are.
nonapplause We should begin with our most pressing challenges -- balancing the budget  giving our children the world's best education  opening wide the doors of college to everyone willing to work for them  finishing the job of welfare reform  passing real campaign finance reform.
nonapplause It is with this in mind that I would like to say something to the paramilitary groups and to others who believe the greatest threat to America comes not from terrorists from within our country or beyond our borders  but from our own government.
nonapplause That is  if we would just get together and get our act together and do what is right and stop messing up  that we wouldn't have any problems in this old world.
nonapplause It's America's most basic bargain.
nonapplause At the time this American soldier was born  the flag of the United States had 45 stars  and William McKinley was President.
nonapplause We were right to take command of the ship  stop it's aimless drift  and get moving again.
nonapplause But they're different.
nonapplause And after seeing Wednesday night's victory over the Devils  I see you're not going to give it up without a fight.
nonapplause We have finalized a new $10-million welfare-to-work partnership between Chase Manhattan Bank  the Rockefeller Foundation  and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
nonapplause And just after our tax cuts  he said the most he could see was an anemic recovery.
nonapplause All these things are part of our lives today and the ambition of the third world tomorrow.
nonapplause John Rousselot is now one of my Special Assistants  and I'm mighty pleased to have his help.
nonapplause And finally  he was up to 70  and the chicken then spurted and went out ahead of him and crossed the highway in front of him and went down a lane.
nonapplause And I know out in the crowd are a lot of local officials and candidates  and I want to thank each and every one of you for serving your communities and for making a special trip up to help in each one of your communities.
nonapplause And now I have the great privilege to ask Commander Ross to read the citation on the Medal of Freedom.
nonapplause And I thought  well  you can't go wrong if you can get pheasant.
nonapplause And this period of struggle and testing is also a time of promise.
nonapplause And I guess one of the things -- people always ask me  what have you learned as President?
nonapplause One last economic thing  a big idea that I think I've sold most of my fellow Democrats on that no one ever thought the more liberal party in America would advocate.
nonapplause It firmly recognizes that the role of government is not to create wealth  but an environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit can flourish.
nonapplause And in the later fifties and sixties  the increase in tax and social security payments in effect knocked about one per cent off the growth of private spending each year.
nonapplause We don't even want to forget."
nonapplause And those of us who are older  particularly those of us who have lived most of our lives  have a heavy responsibility not to squander this  to make sure that people understand what a profoundly important gift this election is.
nonapplause Our budget achieves all the economic benefits of balancing the budget.
nonapplause Under the present bill it is going to cost  if fully used  $2 billion a year from the taxpayer  $1 billion in the States and $1 billion in the National Government.
nonapplause So nobody has to think  you just say somebody commits a crime  put them in jail and throw the key away.
nonapplause There are an awful lot of people -- and some of you should raise your hands -- who drove up here  unrequested  unknowing; showed up  no salary.
nonapplause The judges can refuse to apply a part of a law or refuse to take an action which they believe is contrary to the higher law of the constitution.
nonapplause And so  I know  are all of you.
nonapplause So we had to make a bunch of decisions and we had to make them fast.
nonapplause You can count on my cooperation to make the cities of America once again the thriving areas of commerce  culture  and freedom that once attracted the attention of people the world over.
nonapplause And that's how we're fighting on what you might call the supply side of the crusade against drugs.
nonapplause But we have to do the right things.
nonapplause We Conservatives do not accept that because some people have no choice  no one should have it.
nonapplause And  by the way  I've been biting my tongue about something that needs to be said.
nonapplause In the short period since the end of the Cold War  we've already seen India  Pakistan  and North Korea conduct nuclear tests.
nonapplause Now  what's all this got to do with where we are?
nonapplause I can assure you  it's been authenticated   .
nonapplause The courts are claiming that they decide them.
nonapplause I bet there are people in this room today who have refinanced a house  or gotten the benefit of a variable interest rate on a credit card  or gone out and bought a car at a lower interest rate because of the interest rates going down.
nonapplause I hope Congress will pass it.
nonapplause Governor Ellington  Senator Gore  Members of the Congress  visitors from three States  ladies and gentlemen  it is my understanding that the last candidate for the Presidency to visit this community in a presidential year was Herbert Hoover in 1928.
nonapplause Earlier this year I had the privilege of doing something I never thought an American President would be able to do.

nonapplause And know that it will lead you to the kind of success and happiness you all deserve.
nonapplause And I am trying so hard to make that argument to the American people.

nonapplause In 1991  when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and stood poised to dominate the Persian Gulf  John Kerry voted against Operation Desert Storm.
nonapplause It will be  to be sure  an astonishing age of possibility  of remarkable advances in science and technology  a time when information clearly will widen the circle of opportunity to more people in the world than ever before  and when technology will continue to shrink our small planet and require us to deal with challenges together  including that climate change challenge that Dr. Alberts referred to.

nonapplause Nancy and I have watched space shuttles take off and land  as you all have  and we've spoken with the astronauts.

nonapplause The other key component of the strategy is not only do we have to get the Iraqis and the Afghans to take responsibility for governing  we also have to get them to take responsibility for their own security  and we're doing that in both countries by spending time and effort training and equipping their own security forces.
nonapplause NASA will also be launching an enrichment program to bring their scientists and engineers to students in the classroom and to bring students to NASA  so that they might experience that same sense of wonder and excitement while maybe learning a little bit at the same time.
nonapplause Much has already been asked of us  and a great deal of work is still ahead.
nonapplause Have a wonderful rest of your visit here at the White House.
nonapplause But also arrayed behind me are lives that have been changed because of service.
nonapplause After we were attacked on 9/11  sea power provided the capability to go in and take down the Taliban in Afghanistan.
nonapplause And we were able to make sure that we've got a financial system in which everybody follows the basic rules of the road and you don't make money by cheating people; you make money by offering them decent services.

nonapplause This year they're taking off is only the latest example of a lifetime commitment to thinking about other people and drawing meaning from their lives by helping other people to have more meaning in theirs.
nonapplause If I remember anything from my previous occupation  I should quit now.
nonapplause As I look out in the audience  especially seeing these folks in their uniforms  I am reminded of the fact that we have the best fighting force in world history  and the reason we do is because of all of you.

nonapplause They are hardworking and they are committed to making the community and their neighborhoods better.
nonapplause And so we've got to do something about these junk lawsuits.
nonapplause They want to know if you're not catching on to something because they know that if you keep on working at it  you're going to catch on.
nonapplause Madam Prime Minister  Your Excellencies  My Lords  Ladies and Gentlemen:
nonapplause I had a couple of experiences out there that I think shed light on this whole problem of government spending.

nonapplause But if you look at the changes which have been made in the last 200 years  we should be hopeful.
nonapplause This is the election where we will say  this is what we propose to do with our prosperity.
nonapplause But may I venture to say and state categorically that in our three great faiths and religions  there is only one call that is predominant  and that is the call of tolerance between brethren and between peoples and respect for each other and for life and the fulfillment of our duties as human beings and the worship of God.
nonapplause I appreciate you putting your community and your state and your nation ahead of your self-interest.
nonapplause The diplomatic talk was not of the spread of freedom but of the containment of communism.
nonapplause What we're seeing is the end of the post-Vietnam syndrome  the return of realism about the Communist danger.
nonapplause We set those priorities.
nonapplause So I asked him  "Okay  now  if you just did this simple thing--think about what your mother's feeling like when you're dottling around in the morning--what would you do?"

nonapplause And he kept saying  "Listen to Jesse Helms."
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause I don't think it is fair thing to do.
nonapplause The other thing I want to say is  if I could leave America with one legacy  and somebody said to me tonight  well  you're going to have to go now and we'll give you one wish -- you know  the genie deal --   -- but you don't get three wishes  you just get one -- I'd still pick one America.

nonapplause We have followed neither the military model of top-down uniform standards  leadership training and accountability or a total competitive model like we have in our colleges and universities.
nonapplause Now  I say that to try to drive this point home.
nonapplause There is a reason that Secretary Cohen and Secretary Richardson and our laboratory heads believe that we can do this.
nonapplause Part of the crisis was caused by the same small thinking that's plagued our politics for decades -- the kind of thinking that says we can afford to tinker around with big problems  put off tough decisions  defer the big challenges  tell people only what they want to hear.

nonapplause I was  over the course of the last several months -- and I bided my time  I've been quiet y'all  that's the reason why y'all haven't heard much from me  because I like to give everybody the benefit of the doubt  I like to give folks a chance to show me what they're going to do.
nonapplause Now  I'm a former Democrat  but I think you know what I mean when I raise questions about the distinction between the rank-and-file Democrats today and the liberal leadership of their party in Washington  a liberal leadership that has turned a once-proud party of hope and affirmation into one dominated by strident liberalism and negativism.

nonapplause We can't simply cede more jobs or markets to unfair trade practices.
nonapplause He went to Boston and didn't talk about his Senate record.
nonapplause So I hope if you ever have a chance to go  you will  because I really tried to make it an educational institution so that people of all ages  at different levels of interest  could learn from it.
nonapplause Another vital step the President took in the days following 9/11 was to authorize the National Security Agency to intercept a certain category of terrorist-linked international communications.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the 85th Annual American Legion National Convention
nonapplause They can't stand the thought of free societies.
nonapplause Instead  under this President  our nation has restored its international economic leadership and been a mighty force for peace from Northern Ireland and the Balkans to North Korea and Africa.

nonapplause I had a hard time getting a promotion; I was a governor for 12 years.

nonapplause Such a system  he said  has produced the most good for the most people in the history of this nation.
nonapplause And I'm told that he looked forward to it all year -- that he relished the chance to shine a bright light on an injustice and on those fighting it  and to support them in that fight.
nonapplause But the truth is it's the oldest dream of humanity: the dream of peace and freedom  a dream that someday must belong to every man  woman  and child on Earth.
nonapplause One of my daughter's best friends is a student at Columbia Medical School.
nonapplause That will also encourage companies to invest in plant and equipment.
nonapplause Well  good morning  everyone.
nonapplause Let me also say that one of the most troubling things to me is that the high school graduation rates in America now are getting quite high.
nonapplause And our whole strategy for growing the American in the 21st century in a world economy  but starting in our back yard with Mexico and the rest of Latin America  and then moving to Asia  Europe and other places would be wrecked.
nonapplause And you know  the history of Ohio is a testament to that.
nonapplause Form 1040 will be shortened and more than half of all Americans won't have to fill out a tax form at all.
nonapplause This is all very sensible.
nonapplause But you get the idea.
nonapplause Look  we've got a lot of honest differences of opinion.
nonapplause When we cut that top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent  we're saying a loud and clear message that the entrepreneurial spirit will be reinvigorated as we head into the 21st century.
nonapplause I spent a month in West Virginia.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause Number one  a very large number of members of Congress  especially House members  have actually gone to the region in the last few days  and I applaud them for doing it.
nonapplause But if you really think about what you'd like America to be  there's a great deal yet to be done.
nonapplause We have a lot of admiration for the incredible work that has been done  and we're proud of the contributions made by all the groups and all the individuals who have worked so hard.
nonapplause The answer is higher taxes  and massive new tax increases are precisely what he proposes.

nonapplause You saw what happened to Asia a couple of years ago  when everybody  all of a sudden  overnight  decided it wasn't such a good place to invest  and all of a sudden  all of these countries that thought they were doing a good job woke up with a severe headache.
nonapplause The dignity of both the South African mineworkers and your and our mineworkers depends on this.
nonapplause Now  Greek Independence Day isn't for another few weeks.
nonapplause And  you know  to me it is a very exciting time.
nonapplause Before we got to the White House  where we are grateful for the extraordinary support that we receive from the White House staff  I'd see the challenges Michelle faced as a working mom.
nonapplause The politicians and other secular powers should strive by their measures to bring out the good in people and to fight down the bad: but they can't create the one or abolish the other.
nonapplause That will be the day of man as man.
nonapplause It's important for us to continue to resist the intrusions of government.
nonapplause And it's just so clear that the people of Brownsville are a marvelous mixture of pride and enterprise  and you have a lot to be proud of here in your city.
nonapplause Since I came to Perth four years ago this week  on the morrow of our first great victory together  much has been accomplished.
nonapplause I look forward to working with you in the future to sustain the physical and economic vitality of this beautiful part of America.
nonapplause After college  I knew exactly where my future lay.
nonapplause You have demanded a reduction in the size of government.
nonapplause Heather knows how Washington works  but she always remembers that her employers are right here in New Mexico -- where she lives  by the way.

nonapplause But if you haven't noticed  the market today closed 20 points up at 1034 plus .12  and that is the highest point the market has hit since early 1973  10 years ago.
nonapplause That school district was about to be closed under the State of New Jersey's school bankruptcy law -- which I think  by the way  is very good  holding school districts accountable  and they can actually lose their ability to operate as an independent district in New Jersey and the state takes them over if they keep failing.
nonapplause About a thousand men and women in uniform stood in a very hot hangar -- it was about a hundred degrees -- but they were so fired up  and  you know  it made the trip just so worthwhile.
nonapplause And people act like there's no connection here and these things aren't related.
nonapplause We'll see more impact as we begin to spend out -- the states spend out these monies.
nonapplause My opponent didn't cheer.
nonapplause We stopped taking money away from you that you might need to borrow to expand a business or to start a new one  or to make a home loan payment  or a car payment or a college loan payment.

nonapplause "I was  yes  how did you know that?"
nonapplause I think this is not a problem for McDowell County nor is it a problem for Canton  Ohio.
nonapplause They have not yet understood that unless you have the release of enterprise—the thing I first spoke of—the incentives to effort  you do not create the wealth which enables you to have the biggest package of Social Welfare and the Health Service that we have ever known.

nonapplause I can't do that.
nonapplause I also believe that government cannot do these things for America.

nonapplause I come from Massachusetts  which is a long way from this State.
nonapplause I'm referring to the citations for the awards that you're receiving today and the descriptions of the incredible work that you've done through your organizations or as individuals to better the lot of others.

nonapplause We already have nearly $30 billion in applications -- over $30 billion in requests -- seven times the amount of money we have to distribute.
nonapplause The decline of our relative power in the world was partly inevitable—with the rise of the super powers with their vast reserves of manpower and resources.
nonapplause But we have an opportunity to make it beautiful  because it is in motion.
nonapplause What I was going to say about these schools is  they all have some things in common.
nonapplause But if you look at where we are now compared to where we were three years ago  we have 7.5 million more jobs.
nonapplause With his background in small business and city government  and in the state senate  Jon came to Congress with a great supply of experience and common sense.
nonapplause Again  9/11 changed everything in the sense that it forced us to deal with  and face the brand new threat of the terrorists -- in this case the al Qaeda organization -- that had struck the United States several times before  going back probably to the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993; but certainly  when they hit our embassies in East Africa in '98; or the USS Cole  in Yemen in 1990 -- excuse me  in 2000.
nonapplause And we worked very hard in the White House to make sure that it was a reform that was oriented toward competition toward giving new firms a chance to enter new markets and entrepreneurs a chance to really create wealth and jobs out of their ideas.
nonapplause Let's see if we can replicate your success all across the country.
nonapplause It seems to us like a summons to apathy  like some clarion call for inertia and indolence.
nonapplause He says  "Here  take a shot of this.

nonapplause When he spoke here at Howard  Martin Luther King said the following things -- and I thought about it today when I was looking at Mr. DeBose up here introducing me  expressing the pride in the service he rendered and how it changed the minds and the hearts of the people with whom and for whom he worked.
nonapplause Some of you -- some of you -- like my son's family  are missing your children.
nonapplause Or tell it to the 76 percent of insured Americans  three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits.
nonapplause Thank you and God bless you.
nonapplause In my State of the Union address  I said that we have to renew our Capital City  to make it the finest place to learn  to work and to live  because people here deserve no less and because the District matters beyond the city limits.
nonapplause Make no mistake: You can count on us for leadership  but the goal we have set cannot be set and cannot be achieved by government alone.
nonapplause And that doesn't count the third party expenditures  both the genuinely independent third party committees and those that weren't really independent although they claim to be.
nonapplause On issue after issue  President Bush has a clear vision for the future of our nation.
nonapplause I believe it is carried out on the record of the Congress.
nonapplause But  as I say  we are not without recourse  because there's another section of the Constitution they don't like us to read  especially the judges  and that is the one that establishes the Supreme Court  that vests it with the judicial power  that gives it jurisdiction in various cases  but that gives it original jurisdiction in only three of those cases and appellate jurisdiction in all the rest.
nonapplause If you take the top ten per cent  they had twice the average.
nonapplause Incomes and wages had gone down for most families when you factored in inflation  at the same time that health care and tuition were all skyrocketing.

nonapplause Now they say it's just all an accident  we just stumbled through the last eight years.
nonapplause But if a school continues to fail its students year after year after year  if it doesn't show signs of improvement  then there's got to be a sense of accountability.
nonapplause So today is really a day to enjoy one another.
nonapplause You have shown that the work of the just can prevail over the arms of the warlords.
nonapplause All across this land a symphony of 50 bells will soar.

nonapplause But as our hearts go out to those people -- I'm going up to Oklahoma City tomorrow to tour the damage and talk about what we can do to help them put their lives back together -- I'm thinking about what we can do to try to prepare better for the next one.
nonapplause Last year Henry said he would like to be remembered simply "for being an honest and fair person who accomplished a lot of good for people."
nonapplause But I wouldn't mind at all if  by the time this election got down to the wire  it were a clear referendum on two things: do we want to kill our babies; and do we want marriage to be based on respecting the obligation to have and care for those babies for the sake of our nation's future?
nonapplause And when there is uncertainty  it makes it harder for this economy to show steady growth.

nonapplause One of the problems which we meet in building that vital society is how we care for those who have finished their work  who are retired  whose retirement is imminent  what kind of security and what kind of a life we can give them.
nonapplause I mean  the more money you've got  the more you can afford to give workers wages that are increased and the more you can afford to clean up the environment.

nonapplause We've got a lot more progress to make.
nonapplause You have no idea how much money you're paying as taxpayers to support children that their parents could legally be supporting and have the money to support.

nonapplause And a grateful nation will honor their memory forever.
nonapplause As a matter of fact  I fully understand that right here in the state of Wisconsin  a lot of people are counting on the Social Security check.
nonapplause We also know from the Cleveland Report how very difficult things are and I remember  when I was Education Secretary  going sometimes to the teacher training colleges and putting to these young people who were training as teachers this question:
nonapplause I can't think of a time when it made any sense at all to think of terms of these kinds of attacks upon Americans in the nuisance category  or to -- the equivalent of what he talked the other day when he talked about the illegal gambling and prostitution  just a comparison that strikes me as totally foreign.

nonapplause I say that to point out that there have been good and bad ideas embraced  I guess  by both parties at different times.

nonapplause In addition to his work as economic advisor and economic spokesman for the country and for this administration  Secretary Snow will lead one of the oldest  largest and most important departments of our government.
nonapplause The estimates range from 2 to 2.4 million jobs saved or created.
nonapplause Thank you  Eric Holder  for that wonderful introduction and for your friendship and the privilege I had working with you.
nonapplause We saw businesses focus more on rebranding and repackaging than innovating and developing new ideas that improve our lives.
nonapplause But this almost six and a half years has been all-consuming  and I think it is time for me to go home to New York and to do whatever I'm going to do next.
nonapplause This has revolutionized what every one of us can do.
nonapplause This year a record 1 million Texans voted in the Republican primary.
nonapplause And my predecessor  our first Vice President  John Adams also had floor privileges.

nonapplause We're for the hate crimes legislation.
nonapplause Anybody can do it.
nonapplause But as I say in all my visits  we're going to need all of you maintaining some level of energy and optimism through the tough days  because we know you all are working hard -- many people staying late  putting in overtime  going the extra mile to make sure that the Department of Labor is strong and it continues to be a source of pride  not just for the administration but for the entire country.
nonapplause They are using the most sophisticated communications technology they can get their hands on.
nonapplause Tragically  unemployment is always one of the last to turn around.
nonapplause It's given to -- it's given by U.S.
nonapplause I would like to thank the folks who were here before  Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis  State Comptroller Kathleen Connell  Assemblyman Joe Baca  Mayor Bill Alexander  Art Torres  the San Bernardino County Supervisors who were here  the other officials who were here  and I would like to thank the Olympians who were here  Mike Powell and Evelyn Ashford.
nonapplause I love you back!
nonapplause So today  I want to outline some of the broader steps that I believe should be at the heart of our effort to accelerate job growth -- those areas that will generate the greatest number of jobs while generating the greatest value for our economy.
nonapplause In any event  the editors had to run a correction to point out that the American action was a "series of tactical victories in the course of a fighting withdrawal."
nonapplause Seriously  though  to maximize our benefits  we must look beyond short-term steps to develop long-term goals for our national civilian space enterprise.
nonapplause Once we have lost that clarity we have moved into a realm of confusion that ultimately threatens the possibility of prosecuting the war.
nonapplause What does that mean?
nonapplause I went  with Mayor Dinkins  to one of their schools that was closed after September 11th  they were meeting in temporary facilities in another school.
nonapplause I know right now that Superintendent Sang has something to contribute here  and he will tell you what the next step is.
nonapplause He was the Fire Chief of New York City.
nonapplause I hope you will do more than sign a pledge; I hope you will commit to fulfill it.
nonapplause We're better than this.
nonapplause And we stopped our car at a school  a grade school  an unexpected stop  which we often like to do in these trips  and walked on to the school grounds at recess time.
nonapplause This is a huge decision.
nonapplause No greater love than love of a fallen comrade.
nonapplause But the presumption was that I could not be trusted because I was not in the group.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President upon Departure
nonapplause Just as we yearn to come together as a people  we yearn to move beyond the false choices that the last few years have imposed upon us.
nonapplause So now it's different  and things are going well.
nonapplause One such threat is posed by criminals who exploit this region's growing openness.
nonapplause And that was a step forward.
nonapplause You've just got to reach down deep inside and do your best  and everybody gets a chance  but nobody gets a guarantee.
nonapplause It must be rejected.
nonapplause I would like to concentrate on the former rather than the latter  because there is widespread agreement about the central facts which characterize this problem.
nonapplause Now  people were starting to refine oil for use as a fuel.
nonapplause And I know they weren't told about it  they just naturally volunteered the information.
nonapplause You have to help them.
nonapplause And I sort of began to get educated  and then I went into the library and went nuts over the books  and I certainly approved of their reading taste  and then we got to talking about health care  and first one thing and then another  and before you know it  we were sort of off and going and forming a friendship that has stood the test of seven years' time.
nonapplause But  you know  the whole hitch was that the plan called for an airplane from Washington to here and then a helicopter closer to here and then an automobile for the last few minutes  and the helicopter had to be canceled.
nonapplause It reinvigorates what America is all about.
nonapplause This is not a matter of big government or small government.
nonapplause Our strong and prosperous nation must be a compassionate nation.
nonapplause But I'm going to talk anyway.
nonapplause The second thing I want to say is  it's very flattering now that I can't run for reelection anymore for Senator Torricelli or someone else to say that I did a pretty good job leading our country.
nonapplause That is simply wrong.
nonapplause America has always been greatest when she dared to be great.
nonapplause Number two  we have cut and cut and cut spending in this budget -- over 200 specific spending cuts over the next five years that will blow away this extra spending.
nonapplause And there must be no doubt: As America's first Pacific President  I promise you that this Pacific nation will strengthen and sustain our leadership in this vitally important part of the world.
nonapplause Having been a Democrat for most of my adult life  I can vouch for the pain that is involved in changing registrations.
nonapplause But nevertheless  they worked hard and came up with a great Constitution.
nonapplause But let us look ahead to the force of which you will be an important and significant part.
nonapplause Now  any one of us that hasn't become completely amnesiac about our own growing-up years know that children will have disagreements and arguments; they sometimes will even have fights among themselves.
nonapplause Our economy is strong.
nonapplause Same way with solar energy.
nonapplause And your heart  sir  is an extraordinary gift to your country.
nonapplause Some have laid the groundwork for progress in the future.
nonapplause It demands focus  and determination  and great bravery in the face of unknown dangers.
nonapplause Congressman -- I just call her Ileana --   Thanks so very much for being here  Ileana; and same to you  Lincoln  I'm honored that you're here.
nonapplause He both supported and opposed it.
nonapplause I was at the White House on the morning of September 11th  2001  and throughout that day watched and received reports on the situation in New York  and across the river at the Pentagon.
nonapplause And we need allies in the war against these terrorists  and we're going to have one when we succeed in Iraq.
nonapplause And I can assure you you can't cross a new frontier with an old jalopy that we left by the side of the road in 1953 even though it does have a new paint job.
nonapplause It was an agreement –- the first of its kind –- to raise the fuel efficiency and reduce the greenhouse pollution for cars and light trucks sold in the United States of America.
nonapplause Let me tell you what that meant.
nonapplause The Democrats  led by Chet Edwards from Texas  had a bill last year to increase funding to go in and secure and destroy those stocks.
nonapplause But our efforts have brought about a great renewal.
nonapplause In the Technology Reinvestment Project  which this year alone awarded over $420 million in grants for new technologies for the future.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President To The People Of Little Rock  Arkansas
nonapplause When we talk about Scoop Jackson we're reminded that  above all  politics is about principles  and Senator Jackson had among the strongest principles of anyone I've known.
nonapplause Back during slavery  when Black people like me talked to the slaves  they didn't kill 'em  they sent some old house Negro along behind him to undo what he said.
nonapplause But his career began long before that  as a Michigan junior high school teacher in the early '60s.
nonapplause If successful  our research could usher in a new era of security.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the First Lady to the NAACP National Convention in Kansas City  Missouri
nonapplause For if we lose that faith -- if we dismiss it as silly or naïve; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace -- then we lose what's best about humanity.
nonapplause Yet these are the very dangers which we face in Britain today.
nonapplause If we spent $15 billion a year more paying off the promises that our opponents have offered in this campaign  it means that we raise prices and raise taxes for all of the American people.
nonapplause But I'll tell them something  and I'll tell you: Yes to a nuclear freeze.
nonapplause If you're a police officer and a nurse  who started working in 2011 and you work your entire careers  when you retire both of you will have a combined nest egg of $669 000 as part of your retirement package.
nonapplause Six years ago  when I came to Illinois for the first time  I was convinced that our country had its best days in front of it if  but only if  we actually tried to prepare for the future.
nonapplause Almost every business investment has tax consequences.
nonapplause We're also working with local governments and private agencies to help farmers get water and hay to keep their livestock alive -- it's literally a problem for them to keep their livelihoods alive.
nonapplause But I suggest to you that there are more impressive things that we can do that will impress Mr. Khrushchev.
nonapplause You know  your mission is so important  and it's only going to grow as we transform the ways we produce energy and use energy for the sake of our environment  for the sake of our security  and for the sake of our economy.
nonapplause You've spread your blood everywhere.
nonapplause Remember the dream of Dr. King  the dream of genuine economic opportunity for all.
nonapplause We can foresee  first  changing revolution abroad  new nations  new weapons  new shifts in the balance of power new members of the nuclear club  but equally earthshaking  equally fraught with danger and opportunity are the revolutionary changes which will take place in the life of all Americans.
nonapplause And each of us bears a responsibility.
nonapplause The dean of Yale Law School  Harold Koh  said after analyzing the executive branch's extravagant claims of these previously unrecognized powers  and I quote Dean Koh  "If the president has commander-in-chief power to commit torture  he has the power to commit genocide  to sanction slavery  to promote apartheid  to license summary execution."
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy  Martin's Store  Fulton and Duffield
nonapplause I see many of those faces in this room.
nonapplause We knew what the deal was in '92 and we knew it was real important.
nonapplause I know that when a person gets ready to check out of an office  there's always a lot of retrospectives.
nonapplause It's something to live up to.
nonapplause Their objective in that region is to gain control of a country  so they have a base from which to launch attacks and to wage war against governments that fail meet their demands.
nonapplause How could you obstruct more?
nonapplause And just last month  we got the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty  which will benefit not only this generation of Americans  but future generations as well by preventing scores of countries from developing and acquiring nuclear weapons.
nonapplause But since that time we have learned from information that has become public in a variety of ways that in virtually every case the president chose to ignore  and indeed often to suppress studies  reports  information  facts  that were directly contrary to the false impressions he was in the process of giving to the American people.
nonapplause For instance  China and India are sitting on vast reserves of coal which will be the fuel for their Industrial Revolutions and which will add enormously to the quantities of carbon in the atmosphere.
nonapplause He knows the way to give minorities a fair shake is to open up with enterprise zones and a youth opportunity wage for teenagers.
nonapplause I supported an increase in the minimum wage  because I don't think anybody that works for a living and has kids at home ought to be in poverty.
nonapplause I look at Charlie Rangel who served his country in uniform bravely  and his son who served as a United States Marine  and I think to myself  this is a country that  if we can figure out how to live together  will be strong all the way through the next century because the world is getting smaller; and if people who are different can find oneness  there is nothing that can stop them.
nonapplause And obviously the pain and difficulty that small businesses  large businesses  and their employees were suffering throughout this state and states all across the country were something that we just had not seen in a generation.
nonapplause We are going to get this done.
nonapplause And somehow these processes must take place together  giving practical effect on the ground to the rhetorical promise of peace.
nonapplause There is a trillion dollar unmet market today with existing technology that we are not filling because the old energy economy is well-organized  powerful and well financed and the new energy economy is entrepreneurial  disorganized and undercapitalized  but we could change that.
nonapplause President Reagan himself said that the two men could be friends after six o'clock.
nonapplause Thank you all very much.
nonapplause That's why we're still around here after all this time.
nonapplause The president's policy in Iraq divided our oldest alliance and sent our standing in the Muslim world into freefall.
nonapplause And I'm especially pleased that these young ladies are here today because they're the ones who are going to help bend that curve towards justice and equality.
nonapplause Thirty-five percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college.
nonapplause Oh  I love dealing with the members of the Congress  and they're good folks  they care a lot about their country.
nonapplause But the situation in Angola brings home the fact that NATOs supplylines need to be protected much further south.
nonapplause We've got to finish strong and make sure the accountability measures are right.
nonapplause You know we have so many young people who want to go  can't go because they can't pay for it.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause And we will strengthen national capital standards  so that banks can withstand losses and pay for their own risks.
nonapplause But I also came to the land of my forebears to acknowledge two debts: to express gratitude for a light heart and a strong constitution; and to acknowledge that well-spring of so much American political success -- the Blarney Stone.
nonapplause And so in 1989  in October  this month  10 years ago  I'm having Governor's Day at the fair.
nonapplause Soon the Congress will pass a bill we call school to work  for all the young people in Kansas and throughout the country who know they need more training after high school but don't want to go to four-year colleges.
nonapplause December numbers show a 32-percent decline in steel imports across-the-board  a 67-percent decline in hot-rolled steel.
nonapplause This includes  as Minister Krishna alluded to  making progress for the Afghan people and preventing terrorism  whether it's in Manhattan or in Mumbai.
nonapplause That's the biggest jump in a decade.
nonapplause This is a serious scientist; this is not some fringe kook.
nonapplause But it also made me appreciate the value of the St. Louis Cardinals.
nonapplause The spread of democracy is no longer just an inspiration; it is the commitment of every member of the Organization of American States under the Democratic Charter signed in Lima last September.
nonapplause The point I'm trying to make is that good people will continue to make bad decisions if they're in the grip of a wrong idea.
nonapplause Kathryn Sullivan made history.
nonapplause They took class size from 24 to 15 in the first three grades.
nonapplause Let me suggest three things.
nonapplause He was speaking on behalf of the Republican majority  and the leadership had a big hand in it.
nonapplause And I saw on one of the networks tonight -- maybe it was CNN -- a clip where I was asking the students at San Jacinto -- I said  most of you have probably thought at some time or another that it was terrible thing that politicians spent so much time raising money and the elections were so expensive.
nonapplause Have you noticed that?
nonapplause You know all the reasons why this is so.
nonapplause When I came before the people of Iowa several years ago and said that the top priority of this nation's life was to address the moral crisis that threatens our Republic  there was not a single presidential candidate standing along with me who said the same thing.
nonapplause If you can create that kind of spirit among the people of Missouri I think you'll win the election.
nonapplause You've got a good governor and you've got to get a good President.
nonapplause Leicester is the city of Simon de Montfort  who called together the First Parliament in 1265—although no one would have called him a democrat.
nonapplause You're going to have to speak up if you want them to hear you.
nonapplause No grave can hold our body down.
nonapplause President Bush acted decisively to confront all of these challenges.
nonapplause Today  the dark spirit of intolerance has risen steadily and has been exploited incessantly.
nonapplause It is said that SDI would deal a blow to the so-called East-West balance of power.
nonapplause The opportunities opening up in the future are dramatic.
nonapplause And I know how a small investment like this can really jump-start a whole economy  and what it can do to the psychology of a community.
nonapplause I must say I feel the same as you do.
nonapplause This is what I believe Chairman Arafat didn't have when we were at Taba: habits of heart and mind that tell us when to fight and when to talk  when to hold fast and when to give a little  when to define the meaning of our lives by standing up for the interests of our crowd today and when to try to build a bigger crowd for tomorrow.
nonapplause No country can flourish if its economic and social life is dominated by nationalisation and state control.
nonapplause And it won't always be popular as we apply them to unfamiliar dangers.
nonapplause I remember the question which I had to answer on the School of the Air radio in Alice Springs last summer from an incredulous six-year-old who asked: "If you are the boss of Britain  what does your husband do?"
nonapplause Last year  your state created almost 900 new jobs every single day.
nonapplause And he was telling me about the work that they have done there to drive down juvenile crime.
nonapplause Much has been done  but much remains to be done.
nonapplause Old Hickory's words ring true this day.
nonapplause Now  that's true  but it doesn't quite capture the larger point of what we're doing.
nonapplause And it offers an enormous opportunity for the cities of our nation to have an alliance with rural areas and Native American communities  so that you can't be pitted one against another.
nonapplause I can tell you  she is  I think  one of the most outstanding candidates we have anywhere in the United States.
nonapplause But please send her my best.
nonapplause That is what the United States and its coalition partners are working for  and I am certain that that spirit will continue to prevail when the multinational force turns its responsibilities over to the United Nations.
nonapplause We're going to hold these meetings every few months -– and I've asked for a progress report at our next meeting in September.
nonapplause We will eliminate barriers to charitable works  wherever they exist  and we will encourage charitable giving  wherever we can.
nonapplause And we've committed America to meet a great new challenge -- to build a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade.
nonapplause But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear.
nonapplause And time for them to demand a change.
nonapplause No chickens  no meat  no ham  no nothing  for fellow Americans who live out their lives in desperation and without hope  and every month we give them a pittance.
nonapplause There was a sense that we had to do something here.
nonapplause And that's what America is all about  and together  we intend to keep her that way.
nonapplause The new vision is nuclear arms reduction.
nonapplause Our work there continues.
nonapplause And in order to stay ahead  America must move ahead.
nonapplause There are an awful lot of legislators that forget who sent them here  an awful lot of people in government who have fogotten how tough it is to make a living.
nonapplause We led the way in getting down the food surpluses.
nonapplause It is a certainty that the al Qaeda network is pursuing such weapons  and has succeeded in acquiring at least a crude capability to use them.
nonapplause The award has  in the space of 18 years  become one of the most recognized  respected  and prestigious distinctions in our country.
nonapplause I could only say that as we stand here  our regret is that we have to return to the mainland so soon  but we hope that in the next 2 days we will have the opportunity to meet and greet just as many of the citizens of our newest State as we possibly can.
nonapplause If he doesn't qualify for most generous American  who can?
nonapplause The reason nothing happens is because the political machine sits like a troll under the bridge  saying  "Me eat first.
nonapplause We're the nation's strongest economy -- the world's strongest economy  and I think the prospects are very bright long-term.
nonapplause But anyway  I went into meet with the local government  and I was stunned  in this very old building that was not in very good repair  I was stunned to see this brand new computer.
nonapplause And additionally  Secretary Solis  with Secretary Donovan -- or  excuse me  Secretary Duncan over at the Department of Education  and Secretary Chu at the Department of Energy  are announcing today a partnership that will more seamlessly connect people to green jobs and the training they need to get these jobs  to be prepared for them.
nonapplause They were identified as a failing school that had to do better.
nonapplause Our economy is in good shape now  but we've got to make sure this isn't just a passing phase  a temporary pause in cycles of recession.
nonapplause Americans soon came to realize that dirty air was not just a nuisance  that it threatened their health and their lives.
nonapplause And  of course  we hope as a result of this occasion today and the follow-up report  that the rest of the American people will see that we are changing the way the federal government works.
nonapplause You know  you're one of only three States that has a gubernatorial election this year.
nonapplause But the truth is  these steps alone won't make up for 7 million jobs that have been lost over the last two years.
nonapplause Secretary Bell has told me how much assistance these men have given us as we've worked to improve our nation's schools.
nonapplause Are we forming a more perfect union?
nonapplause Let me give you a clear  explicit example.
nonapplause We are fighting to save ourselves and our children from living in a world of fear.
nonapplause Drug prevention programs that will now go to 94 percent of our schools would be eliminated.
nonapplause It had to do with pension benefits  that the pension plans weren't fair for the carpenters and for the working people.
nonapplause And most older people feel pretty secure with it.
nonapplause My only admonition is  let us don't water down the accountability inherent in this good law that enables us to detect problems early so we can solve the problems before it's too late.
nonapplause And to all of you  dzien dobry.
nonapplause And the way in which it all fits together for us can be simply summarized: without faith  there is no freedom; without God  there is no liberty.
nonapplause What?
nonapplause I'm just so proud to be serving a President who stands tall in tough decisions  who manages on principle and not on polls  and who has done so much to help create an environment where not only businesses can flourish but also small businesses can thrive.
nonapplause What's to keep the legislature from doing that?
nonapplause And I thank you for honoring him.
nonapplause We have to provide 25 000 new jobs every week for the next 10 years if we are going to maintain full employment in the country and we are going to have to do it at a time when machines are taking the jobs of men.
nonapplause And we may not be able to save Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt  and have money left over to invest in the education of our children.
nonapplause Yes  some fail  but they're free to try again.
nonapplause It will speed up research in the development of medical countermeasures based on the most promising scientific initiatives.
nonapplause I also last night had a chance to meet some of the members of Peter's family  including your father  your stepbrother and thank you very much for that.
nonapplause And they carried the flag and they stopped in front of the choir and symphony that began playing the national anthem.
nonapplause And then –
nonapplause You know  what it proves is that one person decided they were going to destroy the soul of their child.
nonapplause But then  when it came time to vote for funds that would provide our fighting men and women with body armor  ammunition  jet fuel  and spare parts  Senators Kerry and Edwards voted no.
nonapplause Around her family's piano in St. Louis; on the talent show where  as a teenager  she moved the host to tears; and then  after being turned away from one music school because of the color of her skin -- her triumphant international debut at the Paris Opera  when she was just 23 years old.
nonapplause I think that's a moment when maybe that little kernel of Himself that He places in each and every one of us comes to the fore and overwhelms all the difficulties and anxieties  so that born in the heart of that seeming confusion can be a light that brings the certainty of God's presence in their world -- present through that very gift of life.
nonapplause The federal government's response is needed and necessary.
nonapplause But we can't do that through more spending and more taxing; that's how we got into this mess to begin with.
nonapplause I couldn't help wondering what all of us looked like up here to all of you.
nonapplause It is the oldest fight in the world  the fight for progress.
nonapplause We have every reason now  4 years later  to ask that same question again  for we have made a change.
nonapplause Please be seated.
nonapplause And this is our prayer  is it not?
nonapplause Each of the awardees we recognize here today has been a pioneer.
nonapplause And I will keep America secure and at peace.
nonapplause Where does that come from  though?
nonapplause She learned about relatives she probably forgot she had.
nonapplause And I'm pleased to be here with my friend Chuck Percy  whom we need back in the Senate.
nonapplause I respected his ability to stand for what he believes  his consistency of principles  and his determination to do the right thing.
nonapplause Internet provides the plumbing to transport data for a variety of applications  and the World Wide Web is one of them.
nonapplause The NRA had them all in a lather.
nonapplause Labour has argued from the start of the campaign that you can defend Britain and Europe without nuclear weapons—that you can deter a nuclear threat by using conventional forces.
nonapplause Why have a debate in the kitchen?"
nonapplause Not just for the world and not just for our party  but for America.
nonapplause All these measures leave money in the hands of the taxpayers who earned it ?- Senator Kerry voted "no."
nonapplause Do you realize we could understand the meaning of that first phrase of the Constitution if you just put parenthesis around "establishment of religion " and wrote "X" instead?
nonapplause I hope they.
nonapplause I'm getting to that part.
nonapplause We always used to talk then about prices  about jobs  and about growth.
nonapplause We're building precision weapons that can spare the lives of American soldiers  and lives of innocent civilians in foreign lands.
nonapplause But what they had in common was self-evident and profound.
nonapplause I want him to only do so when it is consistent with his conscience and when he believes it's the right thing for the people of Georgia.
nonapplause We cannot let this opportunity go.
nonapplause Who is right on the economy and the budget?
nonapplause I have seen some which were wider.
nonapplause And you've looked them in the eye and you've said  we're going to do something about it -- that's why I want to go to Congress.
nonapplause That was a part of my health care plan.
nonapplause I have urged the Arab states to recognize Israel  to drop the boycott  to get rid of the hostile United Nations resolutions.
nonapplause And basically  the other side opposed us.
nonapplause We have endured the sadness of so many funerals.
nonapplause There may be other things which make a British Prime Minister feel at home here  above all in Victoria your reputation for financial soundness and solidity.
nonapplause Poor nations that were closed grew at 1% a year.
nonapplause As we see the dust in the wind today  it reminds us that you must rebuild in a way that helps you to manage the environment better -- by preserving trees that can help prevent a mudslide  or curbing pollution that can cause temperatures to rise.
nonapplause So with that  I'll stop.
nonapplause It has made us the most religious country in the world.
nonapplause After we had the terrorist incident in Oklahoma City in 1995  I asked Congress to triple funding for counter-terrorism  mostly on domestic defenses and a lot has been done but a lot more needs to be done.
nonapplause I know in a crowd this size there must be many of you who are Democrats  as I once was.
nonapplause More than half of it is in autos and auto parts.
nonapplause We say  Mr. President  the greatest honor is to be back in the presence of all of you -- and under not ideal circumstance  but better circumstances than when I was here last.
nonapplause And the Park employees were up there working  along with the volunteers from the Y Camp.
nonapplause But we acted because failure to do so would have led to catastrophe.
nonapplause But I've got a different view.
nonapplause No parent should ever make that choice  and I don't have to now."
nonapplause We have been able to afford a right-sized military at lower cost  but this year we must continue to fight any deeper cuts to defense.
nonapplause Just behind me on Ellis Island  the ancestors of more than 100 million United States citizens took their first steps on America's soil.
nonapplause I understand those feelings.
nonapplause Ambassador and Mrs. Bartholomew  Ambassador Flynn  Mr. Secretary  Hillary  ladies and gentlemen.
nonapplause Transplanted to Washington  his heart remained here  in West Virginia  in the place that shaped him  with the people he loved.
nonapplause But here again  the House continues to wait.
nonapplause A stump.
nonapplause As such it provides a necessary foundation for statesmanship.
nonapplause And it's an opportunity.
nonapplause Mr. Nixon has not sounded any note of urgency in his campaign.
nonapplause Look  if I didn't think we needed it  I'd be happy to shed it.
nonapplause This is a strong nation  a nation of deep character  a nation that can overcome problems  and a nation that will see to it that out of the evil done to America is going to come some incredible good.
nonapplause Yes!
nonapplause And now I'd like to ask all of you boys and girls who are here today to join  at least in part time  in that campaign.
nonapplause You can imagine how I felt.
nonapplause All told  our energy investment will  on their own  create 450 000 new jobs.

nonapplause Thank you all very much.
nonapplause To ask ourselves what the next century holds  what are the big challenges  what are the big opportunities  to dream of the future we want for our children  and then to move aggressively to build that future.
nonapplause Because the stark reality of 2001 is that America is now a battlefield  that the war has come home.

nonapplause But it's also important to remember that we want people to succeeds as parents and as workers  and that all of us have -- our first job is to our children.

nonapplause That is our program.
nonapplause Maybe if they started respecting God  there wouldn't be so many times when the military goes out of control and starts brutalizing the population  and so forth and so on.
nonapplause So  Mr. Chairman  of course he left the Liberal party.

nonapplause But I think he would be appalled at the lack of selfrespect and self-control and respect for others  which manifest itself in the kind of mindless violence to which this city and others have been subject for the last several years  and appalled at the millions of young people who will never know the full measure of their freedom because they have been raised without order  without love  without family  without even the basic safety which people need to be able almost to take for granted in order to be citizens of a real democracy.
nonapplause You figured we could solve the problems that had been holding us back year after year after year  and focus on working Americans again.

nonapplause It's very disturbing to me that America's young people  who with so many years ahead of them have a bigger stake in the future than anyone else -- our young people  I have to tell you  vote in lower numbers than everyone else.
nonapplause It is the battle of principle verses one who claims to be a straight-talking voice of principle  but takes positions on the issues that respect no principles at all.

nonapplause We also went to work on our nation's defenses.
nonapplause Because the American people never lose faith in America.
nonapplause That's what we're going to see.
nonapplause Now  I think education is a part of the national infrastructure.

nonapplause We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us.
nonapplause But again  we've got a new interim government stood up.

nonapplause -- -- and I consider it -- --
nonapplause We have a responsibility to lead the way on climate change  not be stuck in denial  because we're still the number one producer of greenhouse gases -- although shortly  unless we help them find a different way to get rich  China and India will be  just because they've got more folks.

nonapplause And she said  "How long did you remain there?"
nonapplause I do.

nonapplause Better customer service will also save us money.
nonapplause The problem is that we make sure that in the sixties that we recognize not merely the difficulties we are passing through now  but that we try to do everything in relationship to what needs to be done.

nonapplause I saw Cal Dooley  and I know there are some other members of the House here.
nonapplause Now  all of you know this is not some fanciful  pie-in-the-sky vision of the future.
nonapplause What is the right policy in building one community  one state  and one nation across all the lines that divide us?
nonapplause That meant that on every dollar earned  3\1/2\ cents less was eaten up by inflation.
nonapplause It is holding women and families back  and we know it.
nonapplause These Americans served in a war that has seldom received the attention it really deserves.
nonapplause The New York Stock Exchange shut down for nearly a week.
nonapplause Matthew is here with us today.
nonapplause Community service is an integral part of empowering our people and making our communities stronger.
nonapplause Everybody knows we can make it better.
nonapplause So we're faced with the necessity to develop a new way to secure the nation.
nonapplause What does make a difference  however  is that the people of the world who desire to be free - Africa  Latin America  Western Europe  Asia  the Middle East - I want them to look at the United States  not only as a powerful leading nation  but also a nation which personifies the ideal of what freedom can accomplish.
nonapplause Mortgage rates are at 40-year lows.
nonapplause But our history teaches us a different lesson.
nonapplause And I will dramatically increase the number of Americans who qualify for the lowest tax rate of fifteen percent by raising the eligible income to $70 000 per couple.
nonapplause If the House and Senate leadership really care about family values  isn't it time they brought this antipornography legislation to a vote?
nonapplause God has worked through this Pastor and his wife and his family and all of you.
nonapplause It's time for the Democrats in the United States Senate to allow passage of the President's plan to make the U.S. less dependent on foreign sources of energy.
nonapplause And Hampton  that has never been more true than it is today.
nonapplause I must admit that every time I visit California  it gets harder and harder -- and  Pete  you're going to find this out -- to get on that plane and go back East.
nonapplause ALEC has a well deserved reputation as a bipartisan group of citizens  from both public and private sectors  joined together by clear principles  and concerned  above all  with achieving results.
nonapplause And a guy in a big cowboy hat moved out in the middle of Main Street  Fredericksburg  and cupped his hands and screamed at the top of his lungs in front of 30 000 constituents  you better listen to her too  boy.
nonapplause Well  we should be grateful!
nonapplause It would be one thing if after 2006 and 2008 and all the problems that have been taking place  that they went off into the wilderness and they meditated  and they thought  boy  we really screwed up  and we've got to think of some new ways of approaching things  if they were full of reflection and soul-searching  and then they finally came back and said  we've got some new ideas.
nonapplause Bob  Joe  and Nelson devoted their lives and they gave their lives to achieve that goal.
nonapplause I appreciate Senator Bond's support of a policy which says that when this country sees hopelessness and despair around the world  we will not turn our back.
nonapplause One important tool is the OSCE.
nonapplause That's pretty good.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause But I want to say how delighted we were that Prime Minister Peres accepted the Government's invitation to come to Britain as the official guest of our Government.
nonapplause I will say again  it's not only morally the right choice  it's not just good social policy  it is imperative  in my judgment  if we're going to keep the economy growing  to find new places where we create not only new customers  but new businesses and new employees.
nonapplause We are called in this moment of crisis to be the ones who  through our action and will  will turn this nation from its rejection of life and mercy and God  back to its bedrock belief that He is the source of our justice  that He is the cause of our hope  that He is the great provider of that future through which we are to offer hope--not just to ourselves and our posterity  but to all His human race.
nonapplause Those judges made me do it!
nonapplause And we are never going to win that competition by paying the lowest wages or simply by trying to offer the cheapest products.

nonapplause And the Birmingham Evening Mail each week has page after page—dozens of them—of job vacancies.
nonapplause So  I guess I'll be this way till I get to California  which I'm going to do  beginning tomorrow morning.
nonapplause And this is a safer  better  stronger country.
nonapplause For example  Nixon never claimed that he could imprison American citizens indefinitely with no charge of a crime  with no access to a lawyer and notification to their family.
nonapplause But  I said  if that didn't happen  they lied to you and you need to get even.
nonapplause But force alone cannot solve our problems  and it is no alternative to extremism.
nonapplause We cannot stand still because we now face another season of change  another season of challenge -- an economic crisis that has hurt too many people and eroded their confidence  a war in Afghanistan now in its eighth year  and new forces shaping this young century.
nonapplause That means that the challenge of our time is especially a challenge to those who are motivated in their hearts by the love of God and by a desire to do His will.
nonapplause To achieve this  and to prevent economic collapse  we were forced to extend assistance to some of the very banks and financial institutions whose actions had helped precipitate the turmoil.
nonapplause And there have been times where nearly one in five people in this area have been looking for work.
nonapplause This plan was carefully crafted over more than three years in close consultation with friends and allies around the world.
nonapplause Three and one half years ago  in free and fair elections  the people of Haiti chose Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President.

nonapplause And the lion came roaring at him and jumped on him.

nonapplause I'm glad to see you.
nonapplause Here's the point I want to make for you  for you young people here.

nonapplause I don't know about the politics part  but Professor Hawking's insights into equations have altered our notions of time and the very nature of eternity itself.

nonapplause If you can find it amidst all your differences  and we can find amidst all ours  and then we can reach out across the ocean  across the cultures  across the different histories with a common future for all of our children  freedom's road will prevail.
nonapplause All this we will do.
nonapplause The new Mondale praises American technological achievement.
nonapplause It's time to set aside all the politics  all the posturing  and figure out how to take care of workers whose lives were affected because of the attacks on 9/11.

nonapplause The defense bill  leaving our national security at the mercy of budget games and last-minute cuts.
nonapplause Just remember what I said: If every company would just hire one person  and not just companies  but nonprofits and universities and religious institutions  we would whip this thing.
nonapplause I know you're looking ahead to your first operational tours -- to join the fleet and your squadrons.
nonapplause And Australia's contribution to security and good governance in the Pacific island countries is principled; it's effective and it's indispensable.
nonapplause Let me tell you why it matters.

nonapplause Strong to protect and represent the interests of people at work.
nonapplause They can call different doctors and let them know the effects of combining the drugs that have been prescribed.

nonapplause And may God bless them  and may God continue to bless America.

nonapplause Let us dedicate ourselves to working with President Clinton  to fighting alongside him for the 21st century that we all deserve.
nonapplause Well  George Bush's guiding principle is a twisted reflection of the American bargain.
nonapplause But we also must strengthen the instruments of peace.
nonapplause And of course  the circumstances with this kind of an account would be that that's a real live asset  your asset to be committed to your own personal retirement.
nonapplause But that has been the American policy for quite a long time now.
nonapplause There they are  right there.
nonapplause You agree with us and you tell those people that haven't made up their mind -- look  there is not an argument now; you've got eight years of evidence.
nonapplause Now  that's why I did this.
nonapplause It was a second American revolution  and it's only just begun.
nonapplause Two-and-a-half years ago  we inherited an economy in recession.
nonapplause But we've got to think about future generations.
nonapplause And we can't forget those -- a lot of young people who are stepping into new roles and a lot of not-so-young people stepping into roles.
nonapplause I felt that it wasn't serving our nation well  that people would rather tear each other down than lift our nation up.

nonapplause Does the onslaught of charm betoken a real  profound change in Soviet policy  or is it just a change to a new method  a more dangerous one than those used in the past?
nonapplause Now  I'm not against that—we just blew a lot of it up.
nonapplause That has to be our party  the Republican Party  that is saying that.
nonapplause So let's posit.
nonapplause And when he got out of the Marine Corps  he became a pilot.

nonapplause The 1984 election isn't just a partisan contest.
nonapplause Many families are headed by a single parent.

nonapplause It is a crisis that represents an assault on the fundamental moral foundations of our nation--the notion that we are a country about success without decency  success without character  success without moral principle--threatens what may in fact may be the most important truth about our nation's life  but it is not the only thing.
nonapplause Unbridled  that passion can be murderous.
nonapplause The great questions before us are these: Shall we  too  yield to their temptation  follow their path  and suffer their fate?
nonapplause But I think these privacy issues are going to be big.

nonapplause People like us used to go to meetings like this and we would all sit around talk about what the government should do and that's a very important thing and it's still a legitimate question.

nonapplause Well  good morning.
nonapplause I served a long time with Gaylord Nelson  who -- he and his wife  Carrie  were great friends.
nonapplause And the other side was against it.
nonapplause She now brings that same spirit to the cause of defeating Alzheimer's Disease -- not for any gain that could come to her  but because she is a woman of deep understanding and feeling.

nonapplause They have political parties and free elections  an independent media  civilian control of the military.
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen  Hillary and I are delighted to be here today with all of you.
nonapplause I think we have to anticipate that there will continue to be a high level of violence  both in Iraq and Afghanistan -- partly because it's important to remember what the strategy of the terrorist is.
nonapplause My neighbors sold us out.
nonapplause A family with a 1984 income of $15 000 is paying $281 less in taxes than if our rate cuts hadn't passed.
nonapplause I quite agree.
nonapplause That effort includes a home front.
nonapplause The biggest threat we face today is the possibility that at some point we'll see a group of these terrorists in the midst of one of our own cities with that kind of deadly capability.
nonapplause We scaled back Federal regulations -- 30 000 pages of them.
nonapplause Yes  the time is now.
nonapplause My budget also invests in advanced biofuels and ethanol  which  as I've said  is an important transitional fuel to help us end our dependence on foreign oil while moving towards clean  homegrown sources of energy.
nonapplause But hidden in that bill was a special tax break for people who did not need it.
nonapplause In spite of this problem  states often don't do much to test parolees or prisoners  or provide adequate treatment.
nonapplause So I hope that some way will be found for the United States and its allies to close that $6-billion gap.
nonapplause Maybe they're right and we're wrong.
nonapplause It knows neither barriers of region or race or religion or creed  for the protections of our Government must be given to every American who needs the attention of our people  who needs the attention of vigorous national action.

nonapplause It's great.
nonapplause So I went down with a few brochures in my back pocket.
nonapplause It is a symptom of moral collapse.
nonapplause And I hope that they will be symbolic and will exemplify the kind of partnership that will take this country along way down the road.
nonapplause Ask yourselves: Will we create more jobs by returning to the policies that sent interest rates up to 21\1/2\?
nonapplause Saddam sent a squad of assassins after him one night  when he was living in London; crept into his bedroom with axes and tried to kill him.

nonapplause We all know that this phenomenon is relatively recent.
nonapplause Imagine -- you know  I'm sure that in a crowd like this there have to be some.
nonapplause But most of us now are only too happy to go through those metal detectors because we see that there are a lot fewer highjackings.
nonapplause I  frankly  was honored by it.
nonapplause That's the idea.
nonapplause The fact that you're willing to sign on and that you've got a great candidate to vote for.
nonapplause They've voted in record numbers.
nonapplause But anyway  none of this will happen until we move the American people's way of thinking about other people forward.
nonapplause When you've seen a need to be filled  a job to be done  you haven't waited for government to lead the way; you've set out and got the work done yourselves.
nonapplause And to all of you  those of you who are trainees  those of you who are volunteers  those of you who are AmeriCorps workers -- all of you -- I thank you.
nonapplause We've destroyed the base of a terrorist group in Northern Iraq that sought to attack America and Europe with deadly poisons.

nonapplause People have got to understand  this is a big deal.
nonapplause These children must be given an opportunity to receive additional education if the status quo is unacceptable.
nonapplause And so I think that there would be very few people here willing to deny that the majority of the people of Afghanistan are of the Islamic faith.
nonapplause And it put us all in the right frame of mind for this happy moment.
nonapplause The terrorists also know that as freedom takes hold  the ideologies of hatred and resentment will lose their appeal  and the advance of liberty  equality and self government in the broader Middle East will lead to a much safer world for our children and our grandchildren.
nonapplause What's happened?
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause But  if you were just some ordinary schmuck off the street  you didn't have rights  you didn't have privileges  you didn't have anything that needed to be respected by the powers that be  except maybe the opportunity to be crushed by them if you got in the way.

nonapplause We still have a long way to go before we make things right again.
nonapplause After 9/11  President Bush decided that the distinction between the terrorists and their sponsors could no longer be permitted to stand.

nonapplause Furthermore  in times likes this  states usually get a little extra help from Washington  but instead they're going to give the money to me.
nonapplause We can either accept that outcome as inevitable  and tolerate constant and crippling conflict  or we can recognize that the yearning for peace is universal  and reassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world.

nonapplause He says  "Everything is going up in price.

nonapplause It'll advance your education; it will expand your sense of possibilities; and it will make you more competitive for the jobs of the future.
nonapplause But perhaps the most extraordinary and hopeful change of recent years has been the growing consensus  led by the United States  that we must support the chorus of reform now resounding throughout the Middle East.
nonapplause But there is one problem that I perceive everywhere I go--with all the folks I talk to  whether they are for or against the machine politics that has produced that result--and that is that the city of Chicago is run in such a way that it is the politicians and the bureaucrats who are the gatekeepers of everyone's economic prospects  of everyone's educational prospects  of everyone's social prospects.
nonapplause Sheer pressure of numbers  especially on the higher education system  as Mrs. Todd mentioned  may increase the tendency to judge by academic standards alone; but I hope that we shall not  in the education system  lose sight of the importance of other factors—the personality  keenness  and perseverance of pupils and students.

nonapplause And many people deserve credit for this: the great congressional leaders who've been introduced today  many of you -- if I started going through the audience  the people I've known who have been working in the vineyards in this  we'd be here all day  Mr. President.
nonapplause It has nothing to do with it.
nonapplause I'm grateful for all the help that some Democrats have given us these last few years.
nonapplause I think it's important to do more things like that  not just in the United States  but elsewhere  so that people are aware  in a tangible way  of the grass-roots -- not only the grass-roots commitment to peace  but the extraordinary array of competence  the abilities  the ideas  that are coming out of here.

nonapplause I knew that at times people would say  you know  it may be an isolated incident  let's just don't worry about it.
nonapplause You've been a voice in Congress on every challenge they face –- from healthcare and education to poverty and crime and so much more.
nonapplause And then you're going to cut working folks loose to fend for themselves.
nonapplause Yes  the problems confronting us are large and forbidding.
nonapplause Young America  hold your head high now.
nonapplause "We must confess " she writes  "that we are the possible.
nonapplause Now  why does it happen?
nonapplause None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of the community they live in.
nonapplause We need to keep making progress on all these fronts  and we've got to do it faster.
nonapplause They're not for any of those specific things I just said.
nonapplause But let's not play games and pretend that the reason is because of the Recovery Act  because that's just a fraction of the overall problem that we've got.

nonapplause It is the spirit that you showed after the terrible earthquake in Haiti: the Coast Guards  who were the first on the scene  evacuating those in need and repairing the port so that aid could flow through; the soldiers who helped distribute so much food  water and medicine; the sailors who brought fresh drinking water and treated the injured and the sick; the airmen who reopened that airport and then operated those relief flights 24 hours a day; the Marines  some of who had just returned home from the Middle East  who said good-bye to their families and immediately shipped out to Haiti to help sustain one of the largest relief efforts in recent times.
nonapplause We send in budgets with spending cuts  and they want to ignore them.
nonapplause But that is  in effect  what we have said to the women of America.

nonapplause The hiring of labor and the conduct of trade are consummated in the hands of relatively few so that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself.
nonapplause So I think the fundamental  philosophical difference here is between the President's approach that basically looks to private citizens to be given the opportunity and the resources to be able to do what they want to do so they make basic fundamental decisions about their lives and their communities and their families  versus a situation in which government takes more of the nation's treasure and spends it on those programs themselves.

nonapplause In this way  we acknowledged that the differences separated us and the Soviets were deeper and wider than just missile counts and number of warheads.
nonapplause For more than two centuries  America's freedoms have been preserved in large part by our founders' wise decision to separate the aggregate power of our government into three co-equal branches  each of which  as you know  serves to check and balance the power of the other two.

nonapplause And then when I saw you  Jerry  that morning on television in Sacramento  with no idea that we'd be standing together now -- but today I think we can all say with you what those of us who were watching and saw you say then -- the simplest and truest words ever spoken by a human being  after all of that misery -- he said  "God bless America."
nonapplause It's hard to believe that it's been less than 1 year since we first heard news of the startling breakthrough in superconductivity by two scientists in the IBM labs in Zurich.
nonapplause There are ideas that we've already been able to implement.
nonapplause Yes.
nonapplause Before I took office they were killing family leave because it was going to bankrupt small business.
nonapplause The question - will we have world war III - and the question - what can we do to avoid that and avoid it without surrendering principle or territory - this is the major qualification that you must look for in the next man who may be President of this country.
nonapplause And we should not assume for one minute that those terrorists will not continue to come after the American homeland.
nonapplause The way to defeat the enemy is for the political process to marginalize the rejectionists  and for us to train the Iraqi forces so they can find the few that want to dash the hopes of the many  and that's what we're doing.
nonapplause That began to change a few years ago as some states  such as Pennsylvania  and some communities and local businesses began to work together  in a constructive relationship  to find positive solutions to the brownfield problem.
nonapplause And the conventional quick analysis was  well  this is all just politics  you know  it's election year -- or it was almost election year.

nonapplause You have to find a way to tell people that if they work hard and play by the rules they'll be able to make it  they will be rewarded.

nonapplause You know  20 years ago this year I became the youngest governor in America.
nonapplause The guerrillas have taken advantage of these shortcomings.
nonapplause It is the middle-class entitlements  that have united us and brought us together  that also have the strongest constituencies and provoke the biggest controversies when we get into dealing with this.
nonapplause And talking about crime  I think it's a crime that one of the best men ever nominated was kept off the United States Supreme Court: Robert Bork.
nonapplause Both of us know that Section 13 of the 1944 Education Act—which was the section under which the changes take place—was not designed for circumstances such as those under which we are getting massive applications to change the nature of secondary schools.

nonapplause But I just want you to know I'm much more optimistic than the point of view here in Washington.
nonapplause Why  because we Conservatives  by tax incentives  have encouraged others to care—and to care more generously too.
nonapplause I share that feeling.
nonapplause "The new intake of MPs will represent much the most radical bunch of MPs the Party has ever had.
nonapplause The United States has encouraged sweeping changes in free world economic patterns in order to strengthen the forces of freedom  But we cannot ourselves stand still.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at a Senate Campaign Rally for Representative Ken Kramer in Colorado Springs  Colorado
nonapplause In a nutshell I'll sum up.
nonapplause And then  against the background of all the racial and ethnic conflicts in the world today  he made what I thought was a rather stunning statement -- that I didn't know  at least; maybe a lot of you do know this.
nonapplause This state is second only to Texas in installed wind capacity  which more than doubled last year alone.
nonapplause Throughout the fall  we'll be going to -- we're going to be ramping up the loan guarantees that will help us generate solar  wind  and geothermal energy.
nonapplause But they love their country  they consider themselves patriots.
nonapplause I would have the American people lay down their hatreds and their division  their anger and their pettiness  their legitimate grievances and their phonied-up gripes.
nonapplause Today every nickel-and-dime dictator around the world knows that if he tangles with the United States of America he'll have a price to pay.
nonapplause The main thing tonight  though  is we expect you to have a good time.
nonapplause Otherwise we're putting America at a profound disadvantage.
nonapplause Mayor Archer  I know is a member of your Board  along with another former colleague of mine  Lowell Weicker.

nonapplause In foreign affairs  we're determined and strong.
nonapplause We brought out national deficit down for three years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President.
nonapplause And I'd like to say a special word of thanks to my friend and aide  Sidney Blumenthal  for the work that he's done in trying to put this meeting together.
nonapplause Actually  there's no formal job downtown with the executive branch.
nonapplause And  you know  I was saying -- I said just a few hours ago that there was a great description of a North Carolinian written by a writer who was touring North Carolina towns during the Great Depression.
nonapplause They gave or raised $100 000 each for the Bush campaign.
nonapplause As far as I'm concerned  looking ahead to this November  we concede no losses  and we take no victories for granted.
nonapplause So police officers were having to drive around in cars more when what we really needed to do was walk on the streets more  to be in the neighborhoods more  to work with people  to stop crime from happening in the first place; to deal with the community crime watch groups and the children and try to give them good  positive role models.
nonapplause It was also the site of one of his best jokes.
nonapplause Every one of their campaign speeches would be bogus  because there would be no money to pay for all these things they're out there promising the voters.
nonapplause Chefs Event
nonapplause My final point: I would not want to come to this great State and to conclude my remarks simply on the note of controversy that I have raised.
nonapplause And it has the force of a rolling tide.
nonapplause It was those kind of encounters that helped me learn a little bit about human nature and public life and politics -- the kind of thing that's hard to learn if you start out in a big place  where you don't have time to listen to people and see how they live  and go down every little back road.
nonapplause And let us remind ourselves — that in these small islands there is still a great and a great-hearted people; — that across the globe Britain is still a name to be conjured with  an ally to be relied upon; — that we are deeply respected for our history  our institutions  our skills and our sense of fair play; — that Wales  with a great heritage so long expressed in song  in language  in family life  in religion  enriches us all with its unique contribution.
nonapplause And soon  we'll take on the big issues like addressing the foreclosure problem  by passing a budget  tackling our fiscal problems  fixing our financial regulation  securing our country.
nonapplause That's what we had in Iraq.
nonapplause This is what he said:
nonapplause It enabled the search for genes with specific characteristics.
nonapplause The peace of the region will also be advanced if Iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions.
nonapplause We know these kinds of initiatives will support the efforts of community grass-roots efforts  like the one sponsored by Monsignor East and his parishioners in Washington who started an orange-hat brigade  where community leaders patrol streets in bright orange hats  sending a message that drugs and drug trade won't be tolerated.
nonapplause And so part of my decision-making process  part of it as you see when I begin to protect you  to do my number one priority  rests upon this fact: that there is an enemy which is relentless and desirous to bring harm to the American people  because of what we believe in.
nonapplause In less than 200 days now  we will mark the end of another century.
nonapplause I announced part of it last week; I'm going to make another speech Friday in South Dakota.

nonapplause Nobody wants to do it more than me.
nonapplause And we know for our country and for our cause  better days lie ahead.
nonapplause Hillary and I went to the Baltic States  to Riga  Latvia  and had tens of thousands of people in the streets thanking us for helping to get the Russian troops out of there for the first time since before the second world war -- people weeping in the streets.
nonapplause You see  the money coming out of the personal account is to complement the Social Security money  however much is still available after the congressional reforms.
nonapplause So coupled with other technologies  this is going to help you manage your electricity use and your budget at the same time  allowing you to conserve electricity during times when prices are highest  like hot summer days.
nonapplause And that's why I went to Cairo nearly one year ago and called for a new beginning between the United States and Muslim communities -- a new beginning based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
nonapplause Well  those who say that ought to take another look.
nonapplause So  I have come here today to say that the Glassboro summit was not enough  that indeed the Geneva summit was not enough  that talk alone  in short  is not enough.
nonapplause And I told my staff  if they can suspend the World Series in the middle of a game  then the least you could do is find an indoor location for my speech.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause And the pain and the experience of suffering by those who lost loved ones is just unimaginable.
nonapplause And that's not fair.
nonapplause This guide helps concerned adults learn more about the problems the youth in your own communities face  and what local resources are available to address these problems.
nonapplause And then  just after our tax cuts were adopted  he said the most he could see was an anemic recovery.
nonapplause Just last year  businesses were cutting 700 000 jobs per month.
nonapplause My folks love coming to Maine  and they love it a lot.
nonapplause Because of tax cuts  25 million small business owners have each saved an average of $3 000 this year alone.
nonapplause Another example is the commitment to educate and train all Americans.
nonapplause We welcome the recent statements by major companies that security will now be an integral part of product development.
nonapplause the swift action  the flexibility and skill of our units  the performance of duty in the toughest of circumstances ?- constitutes another great chapter in the history of our military  and of our nation.
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen and distinguished so many distinguished guests  and members of this administration  and friends of what is indeed a special relationship.
nonapplause And so thank you for having me.
nonapplause Someone called me up on the radio show not long ago and was talking to me about Biblical ideas of government--how you submit yourself to government  and to kings and so forth and so on--and he alluded to our present occupant of the White House  as if this individual was  sort of  you know  the ruler that we have at the moment.
nonapplause We have to do those things  of course.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause It's a program based on scarcity  and it is one that would put representatives of the Government - 50 000 new inspectors in - and forcing upon the farmers of this country controls such as we have never had and such as we never want to have in the United States.
nonapplause I would like to see us find that courage  courage to face up not only to the challenges within our societies  such as unemployment  and the challenges to our societies from outside  such as terrorism and drugs  but also the challenge of realizing our common European strength to ensure the further spread of democracy and freedom and justice in the wider world.
nonapplause But then  there's so much that baffles him.
nonapplause I don't accept that view.
nonapplause But everything they sang  every song  had a hint in it that they weren't satisfied here  that they weren't being treated right  that somebody had to go.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation Community
nonapplause Before I left this morning  Nancy wanted me to ask you young people what's the answer to someone who offers you drugs  and you beat me to it.
nonapplause We will ensure that these networks are secure  trustworthy and resilient.
nonapplause They draw strength from a lifetime of support from family and friends  coaches and role models.
nonapplause His contributions to American letters are nothing short of extraordinary.
nonapplause You may recall the writing of Henry Thoreau in Massachusetts about 100 years ago  when he said  "Eastward I go only by force.
nonapplause They talk about jobs.
nonapplause My chief disagreement with the Republicans in the field of foreign policy has been that they have not been able to pierce the veil of the future  to make a judgment as to what problems are coming  and then to offer solutions.
nonapplause That is the natural human tendency; that would be a mistake.
nonapplause In my various jobs over the years -- as Congressman  Secretary of Defense and now Vice President -- I've benefited greatly from the work done in this building.
nonapplause I know there are strong views about this.
nonapplause It's been a time of increasing hope  of rising standards of living  of economic expansion.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause Our very unity has been strengthened by our pluralism.
nonapplause It's about the airport security workers who have no health insurance.
nonapplause But the further away you move from the grass roots  the more likely politics is to shift from deeds to words.
nonapplause Now  because I believe the job of the 21st Century generation is to build an integrated global community  I think there are four or five things we Americans should be doing.
nonapplause I was in a school in Harlem the other day  to take a totally different culture  that two years ago had 80 percent of the kids reading and doing math below grade level  elementary school.
nonapplause So  do you want this era to be over?
nonapplause You've all heard that politics make strange bedfellows.
nonapplause How do we make sure that we preserve our civil liberties even in the midst of going aggressively after those who would try to do us harm?
nonapplause I'm directing the Treasury Secretary  Bob Rubin  to negotiate agreements
nonapplause The American people decided to put a stop to that long decline  and today our country is seeing a rebirth of freedom and faith  a great national renewal.

nonapplause We begin with the proposition that all of us will support.
nonapplause And that's why this budget dramatically increases funding for mental health screening and treatment at all levels.
nonapplause This week we debate the second reading of the budget.
nonapplause .
nonapplause The terrorists that sowed so much death and destruction in Mumbai relied not only on guns and grenades but also on GPS and phones using voice-over-the-Internet.
nonapplause You got the point: Voting for anyone else to win Could mean letting Labour in.
nonapplause We started this Congress by saying basically that we saw it as one of our goals to stop extreme legislation from becoming bad law.
nonapplause It is an agenda for America's children.
nonapplause And one other thing I'm especially proud of: After 6 years of this administration  not 1 square inch of territory in the world has been lost to communism  and one small country  Grenada  has been freed.
nonapplause And I am asking you to do this because America needs it  to have a continually growing economy.
nonapplause This is exactly the kind of waste that leaves people wary of government  leaves our country straddled with trillions of dollars of deficits and debt with little to show for it.
nonapplause But we have to do everything we can to try to help small businesses to afford health insurance for their employees.
nonapplause And tens of thousands of people who have criminal records now have failed to get guns.
nonapplause We wanted to challenge people in the other party to do the same thing.
nonapplause But as people in positions of responsibility  peace has always been our dream and our hope.

nonapplause If you haven't lost a job  you know somebody who has -- maybe a family member  a neighbor  a friend.
nonapplause So I'll say today what I've been saying up and down the Coast over the last couple of days and over the last month.
nonapplause After years of being treated as virtual prisoners in their homes by the Taliban  the women of Afghanistan are now able to walk outside their doors without a male escort.
nonapplause And we can ill afford to do it now when the world is changing so fast and when even amidst our own prosperity  as all of you know  there is a lot of trouble around the world.
nonapplause What's really going on is  a lot of these health care providers are under the gun.
nonapplause And I was able to make that claim because I knew there were people such as yourself who were willing to be on the front line in the war on terror.
nonapplause We're now in the midst of standing up a new government behind to replace what was there.
nonapplause And today we're a major political force for change in America.
nonapplause This enemy wears no uniform  has no regard for the rules of warfare  and is unconstrained by any standard of decency or morality.
nonapplause And I'm talking about your great Governor  Kay Orr.
nonapplause But many of them do sooner or later  and certainly  George Bush has had his share of those tough decisions to make.
nonapplause Before I sign this bill I'd like to thank the Congressional leadership from both parties for sticking with this project through thick and thin.
nonapplause Whatever the reason  you are each extraordinary in your own ways.
nonapplause But in point of fact  that isn't where we have our Christian faith  but that's what we have over here.
nonapplause And as I say  all it will do is increase the ultimate cost of coming to grips with this problem because sooner or later you do have to face it.
nonapplause I like to describe this as a generational issue.
nonapplause Inflation and economic dislocation resulting from uncontrolled spending and the taxation needed to pay the bill hurt everyone.
nonapplause So we're moving in the right direction.
nonapplause If we'd been able to do this before 9/11  we might have been able to pick up on two hijackers who subsequently flew a jet into the Pentagon.
nonapplause I leave it for Senator Kerry to explain  or explain away his votes and his statements about the war on terror  our cause in Iraq  and the needs of the American military.
nonapplause Live these values.
nonapplause He says he privately opposed the embargo -- very privately.
nonapplause I wouldn't be really so glad that you are here  if I wasn't so apprehensive about the country's future.
nonapplause And he pushed himself up and threw his head back and laughed  and smiled  and drug himself across the floor to the wall  straightened the braces out and pulled himself up.
nonapplause It's going to be big  folks.
nonapplause Well  we've thrown that one away  and now it reads  "Don't Tread on Me."
nonapplause We'll spend more on the environment.
nonapplause And there is really a continuing revolution  as we all know  in all kinds of computer technology  in biomedical research and also in materials development  which I'll say a little more about.
nonapplause It's clear now that it was right to reject the false solutions offered by some in Congress that would have gotten government even more involved in farm policies  priced our farm commodities out of world markets  and driven thousands of small agriculture suppliers out of business.
nonapplause Now  there are a lot of nice things in Washington  don't get me wrong.
nonapplause ﻿  Mrs. Bush's Remarks at Tom Reynolds for Congress Luncheon
nonapplause Well  is his tax increase your idea of fairness and compassion?
nonapplause African nationalists used to quote Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln  Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson  not because Jefferson or Lincoln or Wilson did very much about Africa and about their problems  but because the people of Africa felt that they were trying to do something for their own country  and because they wanted to be associated with a man who spoke for great principles in times of great crisis.
nonapplause Everybody deserves a chance.
nonapplause The former regime in Iraq also witnessed America's resolve to confront dangers before they fully materialize.
nonapplause Now  despite this  some have had harsh words for the decisions we've made  including some individuals who I've got enormous respect and admiration for.
nonapplause There is not a person here that can't recall at least some personal or business error you made at some point in your life  large or small  because you thought there were no consequences to the moment.
nonapplause And Mr. Marriott here has this Pathways to Independence program that supports the transition from welfare to work.
nonapplause Here in Minnesota  almost 28 000 jobs have been created since June of last year.
nonapplause He is a man of enormous courage and I think that what we've seen over the last year is that he is also a man who has a vision of peace for the Israeli people that is based clearly on a bedrock commitment to security  but also on a growing realization that security also has to include a better future for the Palestinian people.
nonapplause In today's Afghanistan there's a NATO Alliance is taking the lead to help provide security for the people of Afghanistan.
nonapplause I had to remind him that SDI is America's insurance policy to protect us from accidents or some madman who might come along  as a Hitler came along  or just in case the Soviets don't keep their side of the bargain.
nonapplause Keep untarnished your honor  and you of the Corps will preserve this country for yourselves  for all of us  for your children  and for your children's children.
nonapplause We've got a lot to do.
nonapplause However  we made great strides in Iceland in resolving most of our differences  and we're going to continue the effort.
nonapplause Picketing is lawful only when it seeks peacefully to persuade.
nonapplause I want to touch on it briefly.
nonapplause But the ultimate responsibility  the real power  does not rest with them -- it rests with you.
nonapplause And perhaps we should consider Asian-Pacific trading areas as well.
nonapplause That's what you hire people for.
nonapplause The truth is that there's an empty seat in the church pew on Sunday  there's an extra car in the driveway and one less friend to phone for a movie on a Friday night.
nonapplause The news is not all bleak and terrifying.
nonapplause To her tireless work with Amnesty International and her own Aurora Foundation  she has drawn the world's attention to the plight of prisoners of conscience and of their families.
nonapplause Stephanie Street  my wonderful scheduler  who's going to be working with me here in Arkansas.
nonapplause Because we're not coming together here just as Americans  men  citizens  this and that.
nonapplause Thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen.
nonapplause They've tried.
nonapplause We've got a serious attempt going on to bring health care costs under control  which as all of you know  is one of the major causes of America's lack of competitiveness.
nonapplause But I know one thing  you have got to be committed  every single one of you  to building that kind of a bridge.
nonapplause And I hope also that you'll think we've chosen well.
nonapplause We must never forget the kind of man who ran that country  and the depravity of his regime.
nonapplause And I'm sure that you know what the creed is and the slogan is of your sons  your brothers  or your fathers and husbands who have gone and who've served this country in time of war  and that is  "The first in and the last out."
nonapplause That's why I've been traveling around the country -- and I'm going to do this for years to come -- asking everyone to step up and get involved.
nonapplause We have reorganized the government and created a Department of Homeland Security to safeguard the borders and ports of America and to protect our people.
nonapplause President Bush and I have now begun the fourth year of our administration.
nonapplause This is an incredible opportunity and an enormous responsibility.
nonapplause You felt secure if you thought there was a reasonable chance that we could stop big bad things from happening.
nonapplause And as he says  whenever he votes  we win.
nonapplause For the next generation  even if we have a recession and we had to borrow some money later to keep things going  interest rates would be much lower  because the government wouldn't be competing with you for the money.
nonapplause Neither she  nor I should get some sort of gold star.
nonapplause As someone remarked  when you think you are doing reasonably well  you must be comparing yourself with the wrong man.
nonapplause So  when I went in  the rate of inflation was very  very much lower.

nonapplause And as I mentioned  of course  we're grateful to the Fifth Combat Communications Group conducting operations worldwide  from the Middle East  to our own Gulf coast.
nonapplause Thank you.

nonapplause We extended or increased unemployment benefits not just to help those families but also to make sure that there was some demand in the economy at a time when so much demand had been lost.
nonapplause At this point  we've heard all the arguments on both sides of the aisle.
nonapplause That is the biggest threat we face.

nonapplause We can begin by making sure there is never again another episode like this one.
nonapplause You know  the parents here in the audience can empathize with this.
nonapplause Those people need to cook meals  heat homes  clothe themselves  find work.
nonapplause And speaking to you in this building  it is right that I should dwell for a moment on the role of our Party.
nonapplause So  the only ones I can tell are Irish.
nonapplause I think they would say that when a small Communist clique seizes a country  there is no self-determination and no chance of it.
nonapplause This marks the most significant change in Medicare in three decades.

nonapplause Some people can't dance at all.
nonapplause You know  my husband was born in Connecticut  and his family has a long history in this state.

nonapplause But as they have  they raise an awful specter.
nonapplause But you and I know that there are too many young people who go to college and drop out or defer going to college because they think they can't afford it.
nonapplause It's important for the world to see.
nonapplause The reason we don't fight in America  if you -- in a way  we all  all of us citizens promised that we will fight no more forever -- is that we have other ways of resolving our differences and pursuing our interests and manifesting our power.
nonapplause Today  the nation pays our respects to them.
nonapplause But we don't want a U-turn.
nonapplause This is even a greater honor.
nonapplause And we find that the pieces of the puzzle fit together very clearly.
nonapplause And I certainly would reply by saying that other things also are very important: We want better schools in America; we want better health care in America available to all of our citizens; we want better jobs for our people; we also want to see the income of our farm families participate in the tremendously increasing prosperity which Americans are enjoying.
nonapplause Every one of you  even the most cynical among you  understands and cherishes the function of a free press and the preservation of our system of government and of our way of life.
nonapplause Imagine.
nonapplause We got rid of hundreds of programs that I thought we could do without.

nonapplause When for the last several years  we have seen more and more working people subject to the restructuring of industries  which means that for the first time since World War II people who lose their jobs in America now normally don't get the same job back  they get a different job after a longer period of time  usually with a smaller company  usually paying a lower wage with a weaker package of fringe benefits.
nonapplause I think we still stand as a people who can  if we will  call upon God's aid and He will hear us.
nonapplause Look at Africa.
nonapplause And after seeing former adversaries mourning and praying and working together  I have never been more confident that this peace will prevail.
nonapplause It's a sport that's passed down from dad to son  in my case -- actually  my mother used to keep score for the Yale Bulldogs.
nonapplause They richly deserve it.
nonapplause But in truth  those of you who lived through that  particularly those of you who were adults or nearly so  then  will remember clearly that there were a couple of years after World War II when we had to work out what our foreign policy was going to be  when we had to develop the institutions necessary to carry that foreign policy out  when we had to work through in our own minds what America's responsibilities at home were.
nonapplause I appreciate your coming out here on this day  and I'm looking forward to meeting the Duke basketball team.
nonapplause And these guys come and tap us on the shoulder  and they say  “We want the keys back.”

nonapplause That's not what they're doing.
nonapplause In the Middle East  we are encouraging free markets  democracy  and tolerance -- because these are the ideas and the aspirations that overcome violence  and turn societies to the pursuit of peace.

nonapplause So I want to thank the speakers for building on all of this and telling us what we can look forward to in the future; and for reminding us that as we unlock age-old mysteries and make what we can think more possible to do  there are ways to do it that bring us together as a society.
nonapplause I think people have started to figure out I'm a persistent son of a gun.
nonapplause You just show up and you be yourself and you do what you're supposed to do and you treat them right  the power of your example will show them that they do not have to be trapped in the pattern which led to the slaughter of a quarter of a million people in Bosnia  2.5 million refugees there  almost 1 million refugees here  though we acted quicker  and because we acted quicker  they all came home.
nonapplause I appreciate so very much the members of our congressional delegation who have shown up here.
nonapplause We subsidize the highways more.
nonapplause These plans allow people to save tax free for routine medical expenses like routine doctors visits or eyeglasses.
nonapplause I also know -- I'll say more about that in a minute -- I also know that the war on terrorism -- and it's important for us  very important for us to be clear and strong and honest that the war on terrorism is not the Cold War; it is different and it is a challenge.
nonapplause We're fighting two wars.
nonapplause Thank you  General Abrams.
nonapplause Unless we can find a way to honestly and openly debate our differences and find common ground  to celebrate all the diversity of America and still give people a chance to live in the way they think is right  so that we are stronger for our differences  not weaker  we won't be able to meet the economic and other challenges before us.

nonapplause American families can't wait for '08 and a new Democratic president for us to tackle the most serious issues.
nonapplause We've become accustomed to it.
nonapplause .
nonapplause You see  for example  in the United States right now in the last three years  we have enjoyed the lowest unemployment and inflation rates combined in 27 years.

nonapplause Today I am directing Secretary of Health and Human Services Shalala immediately to lift the moratorium on federal funding for research involving transplantation of fetal tissue.

nonapplause The kids in trouble  they go to the child's home and they sit on the couch in the living room and they talk to the parents.
nonapplause No reassurance has been given on this point  either by a Council regulation or indeed by the interpretations of the Single Act by those countries which have ratified it so far.
nonapplause Just imagine -- this actually happens in America now.
nonapplause I signed this bill because this is an historic chance -- where Republicans and Democrats got together and said  we're going to take this historic chance to try to recreate the nation's social bargain with the poor.
nonapplause When you're running for President  you spend a lot of time in Iowa.

nonapplause Anyone in his right mind knows that this will not happen in the United States.
nonapplause I hope that these awards  which will be annually awarded  will send a very strong signal to educators and to those who we hope to enlist in becoming educators  that the role teachers play in our children's lives is second only to parents  and it is the most important job anyone can do for pay.
nonapplause All men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights -- until that moment some might have said that was just a high-blown sentiment  the dreams of a few philosophers and their hot-headed followers.

nonapplause Of course the modern tendency of politicians is to want more spending on their own particular interests in their own country.

nonapplause Way back at the time of World War II  the Chief of Army Staff  General George Marshall  he was asked did we have a secret weapon  and  if so  what was it?

nonapplause But in Jim Broyhill you have a Senator with more than two decades of experience at getting things done for the people of North Carolina; a Senator who believes  as I say  in peace through strength  who led the fight to cut your taxes and create new jobs; and a Senator who believes in the goodness and decency of the American people and in the greatness of our nation.

nonapplause Here was a man who was molesting young girls and paddling children with boat oars; a man who was laying up supplies and illegal weapons for Armageddon; a man who was instructing women and children about how to commit suicide; a man who took the trust of young children and twisted it  who told people that if they wanted to do the will of God they had to be willing to kill for God.

nonapplause We're all in the same boat  and we have to get the engines started before the boat goes over the falls.

nonapplause That is the context in which I hope this debate over the budget will play itself out.
nonapplause His thoughtful study holds as true now  42 years later  as when it was first published.
nonapplause The new Reagan is now.
nonapplause And just to basically review what the law does  it says essentially this--there will continue to be a national guarantee funded by the federal and state governments of health care  nutrition  and now more child care for people who move from welfare to work  but that portion of our welfare expenditures that used to go in monthly entitlement checks to welfare recipients will now go to the states in a big block of money  and they  in turn  will have to move people who are able-bodied from welfare to work within two years  and in no case can able-bodied people have more than five years total of welfare benefits unless there are extenuating circumstances  in which case the states can keep a little money back aside to deal with the odd case that always comes up that doesn't quite fit anybody's formula.
nonapplause Whatever divided us before let us consign to the past.
nonapplause And that's what America's Promise does.
nonapplause It was from Na'Dreya Lattimore  10 years old -- about the same age as Sasha.

nonapplause People with some college education had a 5.7 percent unemployment rate -- that is  below the national average.
nonapplause Well  those days have changed.
nonapplause What's the real issue?
nonapplause I saw them volunteer on my campaign.
nonapplause You have helped the countries of the Middle East turn on the past and start a new chapter of peaceful coexistence.
nonapplause We believe you can be pro-growth and pro-environment.
nonapplause Are these the hallmarks of greed?
nonapplause There is no way around that.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President on the Economy in Youngstown  Ohio
nonapplause But you have to commit to do that.
nonapplause We work together day in and day out as partners.
nonapplause And that's why  after the Afghan voting was completed  I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy.
nonapplause And at midterm elections our folks -- who work hard  have a lot of hassles  and it's more trouble for them to vote -- don't vote in the same numbers their folks do.
nonapplause I was just down in Austin talking about education.
nonapplause They accuse people like me of bringing religion into politics and so forth and so on.
nonapplause We passed in the balanced budget bill in 1997  with a bipartisan vote in both Houses  big majorities  the largest expansion in federally funded health care for children since Medicaid -- the Children's Health Insurance Program.
nonapplause It's all out there.
nonapplause So  we've got a big  tough decision here.
nonapplause But you have to decide what you believe and whether it's worth fighting for.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause The objective is victory.
nonapplause So I find this fall not as difficult as last spring  in many ways.
nonapplause Eating out was a luxury because at least in my family we couldn't afford it.
nonapplause I turned on the Christmas lights in Belfast  and there were 50 000 people there.
nonapplause They are known to have a high opinion of their own analytical capabilities.
nonapplause But we also know that we've got a long way to go; the progress we've made has been uneven; and that this recession has hit communities of color with a particular ferocity.
nonapplause And I want to thank the Mayor and the two councilpersons  and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton  for making us feel welcome up here.
nonapplause I have received a letter  too  from the mother of one of the hostages in Iraq in which she tells how he was allowed to telephone her the other day but had only one message: don't negotiate with the terrorists  with Saddam Hussein!
nonapplause Let me tell you how--about policies I'd implement as President  replace crime fighting rhetoric with actions.
nonapplause We're tackling the deficit issues.
nonapplause I'm told that with the guidance of his mentor  Ben De Leon -- where's Ben?
nonapplause They say about a football field's worth every second is lost  drying out the land.
nonapplause Our greatest security comes from the advance of human liberty  because free nations do not support terror.
nonapplause Well  the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
nonapplause Poles understand very well that freedom means readiness to defend values we treasure.
nonapplause D-Day was such a moment.
nonapplause But yesterday all you showed was why you've been voted the most valuable player of the series.
nonapplause You know  sometimes  with public policy we like to talk about ideology and numbers and charts.
nonapplause And so we want every citizen to have the skills and training they need in a global economy -- from the day that you're born through whatever career you may choose.
nonapplause We're all part of a great revolution  and it's just begun.
nonapplause On the broader picture  Senator Kerry has questioned whether the war on terror is really a war at all.
nonapplause Actually  it's 1 percent.
nonapplause They voted for somebody to clean the streets  open the schools  and give them a job and run an honest government.
nonapplause The bald eagle was being officially reclassified from endangered to threatened.
nonapplause There will be scope for all political Parties to participate in these new institutions.

nonapplause He is going to have to meet a position in the Formosa Straits with an increasingly dangerous and belligerent Chinese Communist government.
nonapplause His roots run deep.
nonapplause Anyway  that's the limits of liberalism.
nonapplause Keep this economy going.
nonapplause I believed that if we followed those three little words in all of our policies  and we looked at the real world that we could find new ways to rebuild our families and our communities  to honor the American people who elect us all.
nonapplause He has used his legendary prowess at persuading people to do things they are otherwise disinclined to do to free innocents imprisoned around the world  including American servicemen from the Middle East to the Balkans.
nonapplause We've got a lot of things going on here  because there is much more we can do.
nonapplause In the first debate this year  Senator Kerry said that America had to meet some kind of global test before we could take military action.
nonapplause We got in wars because someone on the other side didn't think we had the will or the strength to defend our freedoms and our country and our rights.
nonapplause This election will determine whether or not our country keeps moving forward with economic growth  expanding opportunity  and freedom for all our citizens or slips back into the morass of tax and tax and spend and spend.
nonapplause On issue after issue  from national security to economic growth and trade  to improving our public schools  President Bush has led the way in making progress for the American people.
nonapplause But I want to say first to Tom Foley how very grateful I am for his willingness to undertake this service in Japan.
nonapplause We stand with you  committed and determined to help you protect the traditions and ethics that you hold dear.
nonapplause All dedicated Democrats  all dedicated Americans.
nonapplause When I asked Lee Brown to come and be head of the Office of Drug Policy  I told him that for the first time ever I would make the Director a member of my Cabinet; that I recognized that it was folly to believe that 100 or 125 or  for that matter  1 000 people working in a federal office in Washington could change the habits and the policies of the American people that we had to enlist the entire government.
nonapplause We've set a goal of increasing the number of kids who walk or ride their bikes to school by 50 percent in the next five years.
nonapplause Theologians have speculated about it as well.
nonapplause It's good to see you  Mayor Bloomberg.
nonapplause It was worked on for six years.
nonapplause This job of mine is an interesting and diverse job  and most days it's quite a wonderful job.
nonapplause The future of our nation is closely tied to the success and the security of our closest neighbors.
nonapplause And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home  I understand why a lot of Americans feel it's time for government to show some discipline  too.
nonapplause The more that we saw of the tsunami -- more devastation  more heartbreak -- and I was in New Orleans last week  and while the Big Easy still has a hard trip to recovery  I saw hope and resilience and determination in the eyes and voices of people whom I visited.
nonapplause God bless you all  and God bless Tennessee.
nonapplause Now you see  there I go again borrowing from your national commander  because that's what Bob said.
nonapplause Mr. President  from our conversations these past few days  I was struck by your dedication to our intelligence community and your determination to prepare it for the new challenges that we face.
nonapplause Now  the country has been turned around  but we have big challenges out there.
nonapplause We have to encourage nations to maintain open  properly regulated financial systems so that decisions are shaped by informed market decisions and not distorted by corruption.
nonapplause And these words we hear today have consequences -- the good ones and the bad ones  the ones that bring us together  and the ones that drive a wedge through our heart.
nonapplause I mean  there's been so much misinformation and so much confusion and the climate at times during the course of this year has been so toxic and people are so anxious because the economy has been going through such a tough time.
nonapplause Now  if the Democrats had felt that way you wouldn't have half the people on the Supreme Court that are on there today.
nonapplause To quote their own words they "followed its trail."
nonapplause They must go RIGHT across  as I said earlier  all industries.
nonapplause We share the same threats; and we share the same goal -- to forge a future of more openness  trade and freedom.
nonapplause Last week  Prime Minister Clark and I were in East Timor to celebrate the Independence Day of the very first new nation of the 21st Century.
nonapplause Our administration is proud to have strong ties with the leadership and the membership of the VFW.
nonapplause But this is just the beginning.
nonapplause We strive to put a bit by and to see it grow.
nonapplause And at this hour they continue their work -- striking hard against the forces of murder and chaos  conducting raids  countering attacks  seizing weapons  capturing killers.
nonapplause One hundred years ago  in the campaign of 1860 Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend  "I know there is a God  and I know He hates injustice.
nonapplause She's enjoying a very active life here in Washington.
nonapplause Two years ago.
nonapplause We're building on this achievement by supporting efforts like your high school high-tech program that is guiding promising students to college and careers in science and technology.
nonapplause Now  I know that in the context of what's been going on in the last couple of days  there must be a few  even of those people  who have begun to realize how dangerously incongruous that kind of statement is with respect both to the great American tradition and to the position in which we find ourselves right now in the world.
nonapplause In 1980 he told the Democratic National Convention that America should accept that it had entered -- and these are his words -- "the twilight of the petroleum era."
nonapplause A full and speedy recovery.
nonapplause In many respects  China has made great strides toward freedom in recent decades.
nonapplause That's why workers without a four-year degree have borne the brunt of recent layoffs  Latinos most of all.
nonapplause But then a few weeks ago  he said that now he's for them.
nonapplause However  we must recognize that the search for real arms reductions involves complex  time-consuming negotiations.
nonapplause I'm also happy to see a great and proud American  a true American hero  Judge Robert Bork.
nonapplause But I have to tell you that the most important thing we have to do to get ready for the 21st century -- even more important than our efforts to continue to grow our economy  is to build one country out of our diversity.
nonapplause And I want to apologize for being so late.
nonapplause But we also know that healthy eating is only half the battle.
nonapplause On Thursday we need all your votes to keep  indeed increase  our majority in the European Parliament.
nonapplause And as I look around the room  there are very few of you who I haven't  in some form or fashion  worked directly with on an issue -- some of you dating back to when I was in the state legislature  some of you who I've worked with in the United States Senate  and all of you who I've had the opportunity to work with as President of the United States.
nonapplause And he wants to go to West Point and become a general in the Army.
nonapplause Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open  candid review of the options.
nonapplause We all say that we favor broad participation  but I'll just give you one example.
nonapplause First of all  let me be clear on our goals.
nonapplause There can be no place on Earth left where it is safe for these monsters to rest or train or practice their cruel and deadly skills.
nonapplause It's because I'm listening to the people.
nonapplause Certainly we acted in our own self-interest right after September the 11th; and now we act not only in our own self-interests  but in the interests of men  women and children in the broader Middle East  no matter what their religion  no matter where they were born  no matter how they speak.
nonapplause Rather than cutting jobs  they may be able to create them again.
nonapplause And the reason is  in an interdependent world  we are all directly affected by what goes on beyond our borders -- sure  in economics  but in other ways  as well -- and by what we decide to do or not do about it.
nonapplause I expressed for my part that there might be some future meetings between the President of the United States and the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada  if we could have such meetings to try and share common views of people who inhabit the New World  particularly as we regard international developments.
nonapplause It does my spirit good to be with people who never lose faith in America  who never stop believing in her future  and who never back down one inch from defending the constitutional freedoms that are every American's birthright.
nonapplause We are talking about international communications  one end of which we have reason to believe is related to al Qaeda or to terrorist networks.
nonapplause There's so much fear  so much mistrust that has built up over the years.
nonapplause And there are a couple of other people who are here who I want to recognize.
nonapplause And these important domestic initiatives have been complemented by the conservative ideas we've brought to the pursuit of foreign policy.
nonapplause I haven't won all my debates in the Democratic Party.
nonapplause Well  you know  there's a group called the gun club or the NRA or something; they say  if you really want to be an American  you should have any kind of gun you want.
nonapplause We're good friends and I delight in his company.
nonapplause Well  I thank you all  and welcome to the White House.
nonapplause It will simply revert back to form and begin once again to become a breeding ground for terror.
nonapplause No.
nonapplause And the House of Representatives  of course  did pass such a resolution.
nonapplause That's the way it works.
nonapplause And as I sign this legislation  I want all Americans to take up that spirit of the man for whom this bill is named; of a President who sent us to the moon; of a dreamer who always asked "Why not?"
nonapplause The initiative will involve a quality mix of office accommodation  homes  specialist retail and leisure amenities and it is a £100 million pound development which will bring new life to that area  and with the new Tees bridge  it will link with the traditional town centre across the river.
nonapplause Of all the countries in the world  we spend more than anybody else on health care by a long ways  but we're the only major country that doesn't cover everybody with health insurance.
nonapplause We are moving toward a more peaceful  more stable  more democratic world.
nonapplause And we're fixing to retire in big numbers.
nonapplause I'd like to ask them to come up.
nonapplause We've got 100 000 police we're putting on the street in community policing.
nonapplause And you have made me a better candidate  and I thank you for that.
nonapplause You can imagine why -- who has the majority there.
nonapplause So I did exactly what most of you would have done.
nonapplause Others have spoken about what's happening in the real world of America today.
nonapplause It's been two years since this crisis  born on Wall Street  slammed into Main Street with its full fury.
nonapplause They actually believe it's okay to have tax cuts based on a hundred percent of the projected surplus.
nonapplause But anyway  somewhere between 100 150 000 years ago.
nonapplause We must make sure it doesn't happen again.
nonapplause They were denied basic health care  and were killed on suspicion of adultery.
nonapplause As a result  an international conference on private sector initiatives will be taking place in Paris  France  this month -- this autumn with the goal of -- or  I should say  this autumn  not this month -- with the goal of promoting such progress around the world.
nonapplause Well  I'm excited  too.
nonapplause Under our plan  you get out of debt in 12 years.
nonapplause We will think of it as  you know  sort of late middle age.
nonapplause And to the older Americans  we're going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound.
nonapplause It was quite a striking contrast from the Afghanistan that just four years ago -- in which four years ago the Taliban turned soccer stadiums given to them by the international community into killing fields and condemned women to death for learning to read.
nonapplause We got 67-68 percent of the vote there.
nonapplause As Senator Chafee said  with his great help and others we strengthened the Safe Drinking Water Act two years ago with a virtually unanimous vote in Congress  to zero in on contaminants that posed the greatest threat  to help communities upgrade treatment plants like the fine one I just visited.
nonapplause You know  every elected official here will tell you that there are some decisions that you really have to consult heavily with the people you represent before you make  and other decisions you know they've just sort of given you a contract on.
nonapplause So thank you so much for coming.
nonapplause America can maintain our lead in the world economy by taking the lead to preserve the world environment.
nonapplause Now  if you're in the middle of a terrible time  that's immensely reassuring.
nonapplause And this is a goal worthy of a great nation.
nonapplause And it's about $15 billion a year now that we give to schools  to help them do their work.
nonapplause The good of our Nation is at stake.
nonapplause The President said no more.
nonapplause We threw that sign away.
nonapplause That's why we proposed a three-year freeze on all government spending outside of national security  something that was never enacted in the previous administration.
nonapplause Bless you.
nonapplause There's no limit to the good we can do  for there's no limit to the goodness in America's heart and spirit.
nonapplause The lack of it may bring about the reemergence of all the economic ties and  consequently  the recreation of all political influences and dependencies.
nonapplause Oh yes  there are "extremists" and their ranks are growing  but not in the Conservative Party.
nonapplause But I will never be satisfied as long as there are people like Cherly out there.
nonapplause Well  it hasn't been easy.
nonapplause I ask the industry leaders here today to join with us in developing a solution for the Internet as powerful for the computer as the V-chip will be for television  to protect children in ways that are consistent with the First Amendment.
nonapplause That assault includes a threat by the majority in the Senate to permanently change the rules to eliminate the right of the minority to engage in extended debate of the president's nominees.
nonapplause I'm here to tell you that as I have tested the heart and looked into the eye of the people of Illinois  they still want to be free!
nonapplause Well  we threw that sign away  and now it reads  "Don't Tread on Me."
nonapplause I don't know how many of you know when they wrote the Constitution  they put in the post of Vice President  and they got down to the end of the Constitutional Convention  and they decided they hadn't given the guy anything to do.
nonapplause I'd also like to thank these ladies on my left  Anne Thomas and her daughters  Lee Hamilton and Laura Peterson  because they represent what I think of as the ultimate test of Medicare  which is whether it's fair and helpful and supportive of families and our intergenerational responsibilities -- parents to their parents to their children.
nonapplause We run on the slogan that this is a great people and a great country  but we run on the slogan and the view that it is the Republicans who downgrade this country.
nonapplause I spent a lot of time in California during the presidential campaign  and I said  if elected  I would come back and that I would remember what I saw and what I learned.
nonapplause And when her mother told her that she couldn't take on Osama bin Laden all by herself  Amy replied  simply: "Watch me."
nonapplause Because the facts don't bear it out.
nonapplause It needs to be thought of as a war.
nonapplause The leadership of the House and the administration opposed it because they thought it was  I guess  a slippery slope on the tax cut.
nonapplause And we know medically they do feel pain.
nonapplause It is based on the remarkable qualities of the British people.
nonapplause And I think one of the signal achievements the Democratic Party should make to 21st century America is helping to reconcile the conflict between work and family so that people who do work do not feel that they have to sacrifice being good parents to do it.
nonapplause Many Democrats have attacked the President for the Terrorist Surveillance Program  even though it's common sense to monitor the international communications of people trying to kill Americans.
nonapplause We must be willing to fight to protect our allies.
nonapplause My opponent  Mr. Mondale  offers a future of pessimism  fear  and limits  compared to ours of hope  confidence  and growth.
nonapplause You know that rainbow that's in the sky?
nonapplause You see the same thing on the social front where the American people really are beginning to get their act together  not only in terms of their values  but in terms of adopting strategies that work.
nonapplause And I'm here tonight to do one of these.
nonapplause Just punish people when they violate them.
nonapplause It is my hope that President Assad will join us soon on this historic journey.
nonapplause How many likely votes are there on Capitol Hill for this or that?
nonapplause I thank particularly volunteers like Mr. Wood and others who have supported this school.
nonapplause One of the challenges is to jumpstart lending  so businesses and families can finance the purchases of everything from inventory and payroll to a home  a car  or a college education.
nonapplause But it should also remind us that we should never turn a blind eye to any corner of the world in which men and women still live in tyranny  because there are no people in the world who deserve to live in tyranny.
nonapplause Yet behind that one man was a growing network with operatives inside and outside the United States waging war against our country.
nonapplause Who was it who provided attendance allowance for the severely disabled?
nonapplause And then one day  one of the guards threw a loaf of bread into her cell.
nonapplause And virtually every single one of them  I'm saying 38 out of 39 raised their hand.
nonapplause They say that the way to progress in every instance is to go to the Federal Government  turn over the problem to them.
nonapplause Senator Kerry does not.
nonapplause I've prodded Congress for 6 years  and now I intend to take our case to the people.
nonapplause You know  thinking about what your group has been through reminds me of the story of the three gentlemen who had departed this Earth and were standing at the gates of heaven waiting for admittance.
nonapplause And she had a set of maps behind her  the old maps that were on rollers.
nonapplause By the end of this school year  fully 20 percent of California's classrooms  2 500 -- kindergartens  elementary  middle and high schools  from one end of this state to the other  will be connected for computers.
nonapplause And also to understand clearly the consequences of elections and the decisions made by the people whom we elect.
nonapplause All the authorities were hell-bent on cracking our morale and our spirits.
nonapplause I was a Democrat once myself  and for a long time  a large part of my life.
nonapplause Because I look at what's been going on in terms of this whole process we've been through in the course of the last several months to choose the Republican nominee for president--and I want you just to consider carefully  clearly  given the nature of the challenge we've faced  given the fact that we must go forward in November  and we must articulate the moral crisis of the nation  defeat the Democrats on the basis of that area where they are truly vulnerable given their utter and egregious betrayal of America's moral principles and decency.
nonapplause We've come to realize that if we're to protect the American people against determined enemies  we cannot always rely on the old strategies that were good enough during the Cold War.
nonapplause I would like to begin with a word of thanks to  first  Secretary Rubin  who became Treasury Secretary and  before that  head of the National Economic Council  with a passion rare for someone in his previous line of work --   -- rare  to bring the benefits of enterprise to people who had been too long denied them  and an absolute conviction  too rare all across our country  that just because people were poor and in distress did not mean they could not do better  did not mean that we could not spread the benefits of enterprise to the cities and to the isolated rural areas where they had been too long absent.
nonapplause Bosnia is the country that's so closely tied to others  that if that war were to spread it could cause many Americans and many other people from freedom-loving countries around the world to lose their lives trying to stop it.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech to the European Parliament (British Presidency)
nonapplause May it always be so.
nonapplause Well  the reverend came out and he was impressed.
nonapplause And yet we must not forget that all we've done and all we are on the very threshold of doing can quickly be lost.
nonapplause The legislation recognizes that the private sector is the engine of our prosperity  that when we act to protect the environment of the health of our people  we ought to do it without unnecessary paperwork  maddening red tape  or irrational rules.
nonapplause And I must say this passage of this bill today and the reasonable deliberation in the Senate and the way the amendments were debated in good faith is quite encouraging to me.
nonapplause Second  we're now requiring age verification by photo ID for anyone under the age of 27 for the purchase of tobacco products.
nonapplause Have you noticed there's nobody happier than a teacher in May.
nonapplause That means trust but verify.
nonapplause Because  that concentration on the church buildings is fine when it comes from folks who have spent their lives building up the church heart.
nonapplause We need your service right now  at this moment in history.
nonapplause I appreciate that.
nonapplause I see former -- some former congressman.
nonapplause And I hope that I will be your partner in trying to bring about that unity of purpose in the years to come.
nonapplause We cut the poverty rate among elderly citizens in half.
nonapplause Afterwards  during the hard years of authoritarian governing in my country  it was also at American universities and foundations that I found encouragement and support.
nonapplause It's no secret that this war has divided Americans  but they have never shrunk -- or either political party has shrunk from a united support for an extraordinary United States military  for extraordinary service of our troops.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause These are times of great challenge for this country.
nonapplause Why is it we forget it at the level of our nation?
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President in Announcement of Deputy Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers
nonapplause Back stage  I met with a great group of women who are part of our W Stands for Women effort.
nonapplause I'm going to be counting on you.
nonapplause That's why President Kennedy pointed us to the moon  knowing that the exploration of the skies above would lead to unimagined discoveries here on Earth.
nonapplause And that is not right.
nonapplause Many of you do.
nonapplause But it's been my experience in life that whenever I was involved in anything and I read about it in the papers  they always got it just a little bit wrong.
nonapplause And I want you and every one here to know what an honor it is to share this platform with so many of North Carolina's finest public officials devoted to their State and Nation -- my friends  Governor Jim Martin and Congressmen Alex McMillan and Bill Hendon.
nonapplause In 1994  when we started  3 percent of the classrooms and 35 percent of the schools had an Internet connection.
nonapplause After the World Trade Center attack in 1993 came the murders at the Saudi Arabian National Guard Training Center in Riyadh  in 1995; the simultaneous bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania  in 1998; and the attack on the USS Cole  in 2000.
nonapplause One is about the question: What is a Communist?
nonapplause We have understood that  regardless of party  right through the first two years of our administration.
nonapplause Now the question is whether the world will exist half slave and half free.
nonapplause Many American universities have satellite campuses where working people like me can obtain degrees at locations near their homes and offices.
nonapplause They have to pass it directly to the employee.
nonapplause We come to this moment grateful for its blessings  but conscious of the grave responsibility it carries.
nonapplause Richard Peck has written more than 25 novels for younger readers which stress the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions.
nonapplause This was the day after the attack  and the president did not ask about Osama bin Laden.
nonapplause Right now  at this very moment as you sit here  the USS Saratoga and her battle group are steaming in the Adriatic to help enforce the nofly zone and to protect the safe havens in Bosnia.
nonapplause Like illegal gambling or prostitution.
nonapplause As you may know  I was a Democrat once myself  until I learned that the liberal leadership of that party had gotten completely out of step with the hard-working  patriotic members of the Democrat Party -- the rank and file who make up that party across the Nation.
nonapplause We must cherish our nation  work to make her better still  and never stop saying this simple prayer: God bless America.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President Upon Departure
nonapplause It's true.
nonapplause Your President will support you.
nonapplause Most of us are not terrorists  but we don't object to going through those metal detectors at airports; in fact  we kind of like them now because we think they keep us alive.
nonapplause So that brings me to this next point I want to make.
nonapplause We must also keep our democracies healthy and open.
nonapplause I think  as we look back  we have to realize -- and I have been acting with the NAACP and other organizations -- that the Niagara Movement laid the base for the development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
nonapplause But the Supreme Court has told Congress the ball is in its court; it must act to give FDA tobacco regulations the force of law.
nonapplause Six years ago when I became President  one of my most urgent priorities was to put the federal government on the side of supporting our police officers and reducing the crime rate.
nonapplause I have made my concerns to President Karzai pretty clear -- not pretty clear  very clear -- and that in order for him to gain the confidence of his people  and the confidence of the world  he's got to do something about it  with our help.
nonapplause This is not a government-inspired  deficit-driven recovery.
nonapplause He has already made the sacrifice.
nonapplause It could not be more important.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause To meet this goal  the Recovery Act included the largest investment in education in history while preventing hundreds of thousands of educators from being fired because of state budget shortfalls.
nonapplause That in point of fact  this country was founded and has maintained itself because of a dedication to the vindication of the human capacity for self-government and freedom.
nonapplause So I'm walking up on the stage  and Saxby says  if you keep it short  we might be able to get a round of golf in.
nonapplause So I hope we're here because we want you to feel energized.
nonapplause We created an energy institute in Colorado.
nonapplause I've seen numbers--six million  ten million  twelve million  fifteen million  all the way up to twenty-five million--and what that kind of numbers game tells you is that nobody knows  that this situation is so far out of control that we don't even know how far it's out of control.
nonapplause What it was going for was first huge tax cuts.
nonapplause One way we can help is to develop markets for natural forest products  to provide an alternative income for farmers.
nonapplause Today we remember the path he climbed to such extraordinary peaks.
nonapplause That was the compact I made with students all over America in 1992: If I became president  I would try to open the doors of education to all young Americans  never make the cost a deterrent  but you've got to pay your loan back.
nonapplause They're the families who see the "For Sale" signs lining the streets; who see neighbors leave  and homes standing vacant  and lawns slowly turning brown.
nonapplause One of the great things about the United States is  is that you can speak your mind and you can protest; that's part of our tradition.
nonapplause So now what we should be doing is  instead of patting ourselves on the back for nearly now 15 million new jobs and the lowest unemployment rate and the lowest inflation rate in a generation  the lowest welfare roles in a generation  lowest crime rate in a generation -- we should be thinking about how we can use this moment to look to the future and to build it.

nonapplause I want to thank Buddy Young  who worked with him as our regional official in Texas  who is here today.
nonapplause It ought to be the greatest capital in the world.
nonapplause And the fact that you are doing so much in an aggressive way on prevention is something that I hope everyone in this room will strongly support the President on and strongly keep working for  because otherwise  it can take away all these economic things that we're doing  and you have to be very serious about it.

nonapplause And now that the crowds are gone  and the Mall is silent  and our family has settled into our new home  the White house  this gown is one of the most tangible things I have left to remember that day.
nonapplause And I could go through the environment and health care  and the patients' bill of rights  and every other issue  and make the same case.
nonapplause As citizens of this country  all we can do is try to present the issues and the different positions we take on the great matters that disturb our country.

nonapplause Why?
nonapplause Our proposal  when fully implemented  will save the taxpayers $12 billion over a six-year period  while lowering the cost of college loans to the student  and reducing the hassles to you.

nonapplause So —I have my little nephew with me  and I'm walking down the midway looking at all the games and waiting for Hillary to finish meeting with the farmers.

nonapplause In domestic policy  we continue to face two great challenges  two challenges on which our administration will continue to need your help.
nonapplause Before leaving  I'd like to just say how delighted I was to be able to talk to all of you young people.
nonapplause But the last time we had the longest economic expansion in history was in the decade of the 1960s  between 1961 and 1969.
nonapplause It's a reform that would make it easier for Americans to keep more of their own earnings; that would create new jobs by fostering economic growth; and that would make it easier for our children and grandchildren to raise families of their own.
nonapplause solved our problems.
nonapplause It's a two-way conversation.
nonapplause And while things aren't nearly back to normal out here  they're getting back to normal pretty quick up there.

nonapplause People cannot spend money they do not have.
nonapplause The rapid advance of science presents us with the hope of eventual cures for terrible diseases  and with profound moral and ethical dilemmas.
nonapplause That's how much less the deficit will be.
nonapplause Right?
nonapplause Some of the remedies are in the hands of the developing countries themselves.
nonapplause And the people of Indonesia responded in kind.
nonapplause Finally  let me say  I found  with the help of some of our people who know I'm interested in Scripture  a verse from Isaiah that I think captures what you've all been through.
nonapplause Since our administration came into office  our militaries have expanded cooperation -- not maintained  expanded -- cooperation on joint exercises and missile defense.
nonapplause Last year I fought for a law requiring every state to expel any student who brings a gun to a school for a year -- no excuses.
nonapplause See  government can hand out money.
nonapplause Now I suppose somebody will say now  "Mr. Nixon  you talked about a bedtime story.
nonapplause Tough luck  you're on your own.
nonapplause Because of your geographical location  I would imagine that any kind of manufacturing operation would be a good operation here  because there are good transportation networks in and out of here to the rest of Europe and because  frankly  the continent is not that large.
nonapplause The administration however has asked for $180 million for new cemeteries.
nonapplause And I think there's universal agreement about that point here in Washington.
nonapplause "What happened today?"
nonapplause And I certainly did so with considerable trepidation after Aida's wonderful comments  and with Secretary Cisneros  Secretary Pena  General McCaffrey  Ambassador Babbitt  and others.
nonapplause But something tells me that this may in fact help me to overcome one of the standard difficulties of politicians  you see  because you have probably noticed that one of the problems most politicians have is they don't listen.
nonapplause We think we ought to have a no social promotion policy  and that every kid who needs to get pre-school should get it; and every child who needs to be in an after-school program should have it; and we ought to have a strategy for turning around or shutting down failing schools  and that's what we ought to fund.
nonapplause Please be seated.
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen  I am delighted to be back here.
nonapplause We work for it  and these politicians are actually going to let us keep some?
nonapplause And then some of these old white-minded Negroes do the same thing  they say  "That's racism  I don't want to belong to anything that's all Black."

nonapplause The Socialists claim that all this is necessary because capitalism has failed the nation.
nonapplause Well  it was a challenge  but with the commitment and hard work of a team of dedicated elected officials -- Don Nickles has been a real champion on that team -- we've put America's economic house in order and opened the door to growth  opportunity  and jobs.
nonapplause And there's a lot of debate and it's a healthy thing.
nonapplause Just consider the picture of three decades ago: cross-border war; communist subversion; anxiety that America was literally in retreat; fearful talk of a "bamboo curtain" being drawn across the Pacific.
nonapplause I know President Bush is plenty smart  and while I have no doubt that his religious belief is genuine  and it's an important motivation for many things that he does in life  as it is for me  and for most of you  I'm convinced that most of the president's frequent departures from fact based analysis have much more to do with right-wing political and economic ideology than with the Bible.
nonapplause They have been making a great fuss over the South only to blind us to what is happening here in the North.
nonapplause And in striving for this  we will not compromise in our commitment to restore the right to pray to the schoolchildren of America.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause Some will argue  I know  that reducing tax rates now will be inflationary.
nonapplause Of course  we do.
nonapplause Imagine what a great project that would be to rebuild America.

nonapplause Of course  like Ronald Reagan  Ben started out as a Democrat - so did my dad -- and in his career has become one of the best known and one of the most admired public servants in the American West.
nonapplause That's what's at stake -– nothing less than our primacy in the world.
nonapplause And let's don't kid ourselves  the reason that our party didn't win the Congress  in my judgment  more than anything else  is what they did in those rural districts to us again  just like they did in 1994 on guns.

nonapplause Thereafter  after we get the surpluses reduced to manageable proportion  then the farmers can regain their freedom to grow what they wish for markets  free of burden of accumulated stocks on the economy.
nonapplause And today -- it's taken blood  sweat  and tears  and a few legislative victories -- but I am pleased to report to you tonight America's star is rising again  and it is the star of the future.
nonapplause That's why we need big buyers groups.
nonapplause And sometimes loving your country demands that you speak truth to power.

nonapplause Last time I looked  the legislature with the concurrence of the executive makes the law.
nonapplause That is a cop-out.
nonapplause That all men were created was a truth self-evident  and to secure the rights that God gave us was the role of government.
nonapplause And I can't emphasize this more -– this bill controls the programs that provide school lunches to kids all across the country.
nonapplause And despite the skepticism when we first announced these plans  we are moving in this direction.
nonapplause Our tax program will barely offset a built-in tax increase of some $300 billion condoned by my predecessor.

nonapplause And people ought to be allowed to take advantage of that  if they choose.
nonapplause The decade of the '90s saw many more attacks: the bombing at the World Trade Center in 1993; the murders at the Saudi Arabian National Guard Training Center in Riyadh in 1995; the killings at the Khobar Towers in 1996; the simultaneous bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; the attack on the USS Cole in 2000  which cost the lives of some 17 American sailors.

nonapplause We're out to keep the peace  to make the world more peaceful  to make our nation and other nations more secure  and we're going to free the people of Iraq from the clutches of Saddam Hussein and his murderous allies.
nonapplause It's a sort of a slippery slope.
nonapplause The great English historian  Thomas Babington Macaulay  wrote more than a century ago that free trade  one of the greatest blessings which a government can confer on a people  is unpopular in almost every country.
nonapplause Science cannot produce any of the things that are required in order for human life to be graced and blessed by the bitter fruits of human conscience  because that requires moral disposition  moral education  moral judgment  moral law  and those things cannot be deciphered by science.
nonapplause And it's vital for us as a nation to make certain that we do take on those issues  and he has provided leadership to do exactly that.
nonapplause For more than 2 years  we've been trying to get Federal enterprise zone legislation enacted  but the liberals who control the House of Representatives have bottled it up.
nonapplause The project fulfills the government's charge to create the conditions for economic expansion and job growth by respecting our duties to the environment.
nonapplause On the other hand  what's the paradox?
nonapplause We shall awaken the great majority that will insist on respect for our children in the womb  on respect for our rights in the world  on respect for the dignity of those parents who seek not self-indulgence but  through self-sacrifice  the hope of our people!
nonapplause That's right  45 minutes.
nonapplause And our agencies have just been phenomenal  rallying around to make this possible.
nonapplause You ought to be able to go to the nearest emergency room.
nonapplause We are the only major country in the world that not only does not provide coverage for all American working families  we are going in reverse.
nonapplause And now  we have a chance -- not a guarantee  but a chance -- to work with these folks to build a lasting peace in the Balkans.

nonapplause As I mentioned before  Harry Reid made this a top priority.

nonapplause The leader who sits in the Oval Office -- and the men and women who represent you on Capitol Hill -- will set the course of the war on terror  and set the direction for the American economy.

nonapplause I think it's better than mine.
nonapplause So I come here tonight to join you in paying tribute to a citizen who has met his responsibilities as a citizen  who has shown versatility in meeting his obligation  head of the chamber of commerce  as an attorney  as a political leader.
nonapplause And looking back  this seems to be a pattern in my life -- the unexpected turns  the opportunities that come suddenly and change one's plans overnight.
nonapplause Why shouldn't people be confused about public issues?
nonapplause We've been working on this steadily  the United States has worked very hard here and we've worked very hard to help other countries throughout the world  and especially to avoid any disasters in military operations  in airline operations  things that could really have a profound impact on us.
nonapplause It's an honor to join you in supporting Kevin's energetic  optimistic campaign.
nonapplause Incidentally  the inflation rate for the last 4 months has been 2\1/2\ percent.
nonapplause With your help  we've worked hard to put that mandate into effect in this second term.
nonapplause And Peter is right -- I do love the cool ocean breezes and did have my window open last night.

nonapplause And after all  how many times have we been told by this president that our policy is that as the Iraqis stand up  we will stand down?
nonapplause Is this the nation that stood alone in 1940 against the collapse of European civilisation?
nonapplause These are not the things that you necessarily think about in political campaigns.
nonapplause Let them know how you feel  individually and through your various trade organizations.
nonapplause You have a history  and you have a tradition.

nonapplause They demand action that is bold and sustained.
nonapplause So my job as the President is to rally -- rally the spirit of the nation  and to thank those who are integrally involved in helping people help themselves.
nonapplause Now  what that means  bottom line  is that we have to move about another 900 000 to 1 million people in the work force in the next four years to meet the requirements of the law  which will move about 2.5 million people off welfare  because the average welfare family is about 2.5  2.6 million  something like that.

nonapplause I'm trying to get the Congress to completely change the way we give out federal money  and only support things that we know work  and stop supporting things we know don't work.
nonapplause Other countries have succeeded against worse odds than we have faced.
nonapplause Ten countries of Asia voted against us  and three Asian countries abstained.
nonapplause When I first announced our mission  I told the American people it may take a while  that we must show discipline and resolve and we must be steadfast in our purpose.
nonapplause The word "information technology" was scarcely known ten years ago.
nonapplause Thereafter  U.S. forces withdrew from Somalia.
nonapplause I think in my first year of working  I've made more than both of my parents combined.
nonapplause And it's reflected in my policies.
nonapplause And if anybody has some water down there  that'd be great.
nonapplause At the moment  as you know  we have the problem of inflation which means that we have actually paid ourselves more than the goods we have produced and we have to take the necessary steps to get it down because otherwise it would grow like a cancer and we should be in real difficulty.
nonapplause There you go.
nonapplause He says today  we made a terrible mistake to pass it -- that it was anti-business.
nonapplause That's what's made the difference for so many successful people.
nonapplause I happen to believe that's an important part of what justice and compassion are all about.
nonapplause When Suzanne Dubose was up here talking about scientists slowing down the speed of light and the rest of us speeding up the speed of justice  I wish I had thought of that myself.
nonapplause I want to appreciate you for your hard work.
nonapplause And my friend of so many years  John Lewis  whom I knew before I ever decided to run for President  who started with me  and as you can hear  is going out with me  finishing.
nonapplause Somewhere within your reach  there is the wherewithal  there are the resources  there is the time that will provide the winning margin that will save a baby's life  and with it  a mother's soul.
nonapplause That's what we have to do on the abortion issue  not run away with it  not play with it  because if we don't face it forthrightly we will never get back to the principles that have made this country strong and great.
nonapplause Think of that.
nonapplause The point is  we need to figure out solutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't prevent you from reaching your potential.
nonapplause It's hard.
nonapplause And  you know  you'll have to go through the application process and all of that.
nonapplause I want you to recover the spirit  the genius of the New Hampshire town hall meeting  of all those visits we had in 1992.
nonapplause Ditto for Washington State and  also  Virginia  where the school board of education plans to overhaul their public school curriculum this summer.
nonapplause It's also not what the Republicans were looking for  which was basically to deregulate the insurance industry  arguing that somehow this would cut down costs -- something that defies the experience of everybody who's dealt with an insurance company out there.
nonapplause No.
nonapplause But we must set up a system in which insurance companies themselves will not be forced into bankruptcy if we make it illegal to drop them  which is why it is important for people to be able to be insured in large pools.
nonapplause I just left a town hall meeting in Nashua  where I talked to a woman who lost her health insurance because she had a sick child and because she lost her job  and now nobody will hire her because they don't want to take her son's insurance on because the child is sick.
nonapplause The United States is better than that.
nonapplause This State says  "Show me ' and I think you have to be shown.
nonapplause But you've placed duty ahead of convenience  and service above self-interest.
nonapplause Today  in most families  both parents are working full time.
nonapplause And she smiled  and said  "Just remember."
nonapplause We're honored to have them in the White House today.
nonapplause He was raised on a farm  he's a highly decorated Vietnam war veteran  and Mike has the kind of experience that will make him a strong leader as Governor of the Sunflower State.
nonapplause In 1992  we said that we were bringing a new democratic philosophy to the country.
nonapplause And among our men and women in uniform  we've seen morale soar as we've given them the pay and the training they've always deserved.
nonapplause Thank you  J.C.  for helping set up this meeting.
nonapplause The old idea  for example  that during the Cold War that we could deter the Soviets from launching an attack against the United States was based on holding at risk their territory  so they knew if they were foolish enough to start something  that they would pay a terrible price.
nonapplause There is no real right or left.
nonapplause It's time for a change  so take a chance on us.
nonapplause The juvenile crime rate has not dropped so much.
nonapplause And this is a great option.
nonapplause And I want to thank the AFL-CIO for all you've done to fight for jobs  to fight for tax cuts for the middle class  to fight for reforms that will rein in the special interests  and to fight for policies that aren't just going to rebuild this economy but are actually going to put us on a long-term path of sustainable growth that is good for all Americans.
nonapplause I want to thank you  Mr. Secretary.
nonapplause It hasn't been easy.
nonapplause One study found that African Americans ate 32 percent more fruits and vegetables for each additional supermarket in their community.
nonapplause It's happening right now.
nonapplause I don't think anybody in this audience could feel stronger than I do on the subject of disarmament and peace.
nonapplause The Superfund has now gone from a surplus of almost $4 billion to a deficit of $175 million.
nonapplause He said his number one priority is repealing the law we passed to prevent health insurance companies from denying you coverage or dropping your coverage just because you got sick.
nonapplause But we have to find a way for the American tide to lift every boat in America.
nonapplause And when he is done  we will have completed the education that the convention has offered to the American people: an education that has ripped the mask off the Democrats who have presented themselves as Republicans.
nonapplause That is true -- not a guarantee but a chance.
nonapplause Bodies and pieces of bodies were everywhere.
nonapplause I'm convinced they do all genuinely want this peace process to work.
nonapplause It's called the compounding rate of interest.
nonapplause As leaders  Martin Luther King and Mrs.
nonapplause We are engaging the enemy as we must  in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  so we will not have to face them here at home.
nonapplause And Labour spokesmen at that time said this.
nonapplause You know  I've read a lot of the constitutions of other countries  including the Soviet Constitution.
nonapplause These people are our customers.
nonapplause And we'll work to give Africa's children the advantages of literacy and learning so they can build Africa's future.
nonapplause I do not believe that the tide of history necessarily is on either side.
nonapplause That's like a second mortgage  a Mondale mortgage.
nonapplause It's no secret there is a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another.
nonapplause And if we're lucky enough to be parents  we see it firsthand  up close.
nonapplause And I told her today  she just hit me one more time  I got a huge applause in the State of the Union address a couple of years ago  railing against the HMOs and hospitals that kicked people out after drive-by surgery.
nonapplause Those who refused to game the system are at a disadvantage.
nonapplause But I love Boston.
nonapplause Therefore  when we reform welfare  we should do it in a way that lifts people up  not that divides people and tries to
nonapplause Italians and Americans know that we must act with all the urgency this danger demands.
nonapplause Fundamentally we've had four elections now where we're competitive.
nonapplause Now that our friend Rosa Parks has gone on to her just reward  now that she has gone home and left us behind  let us never forget that in that simple act and a lifetime of grace and dignity  she showed us every single day what it means to be free.
nonapplause That will strengthen those in China who fight for decent labor standards  a cleaner environment  human rights and the rule of law.
nonapplause That's how we can incentivize excellence and spur reform and launch a race to the top in America's public schools.
nonapplause One quick example on that: chlorofluorocarbons  the culprits in the ozone hole  which you all know about very  very well  they were first invented in this century  and they weren't produced in large quantities until after World War II.
nonapplause So in spite of all this happy talk about global cooperation  it has never been a real possibility until 13 years ago.
nonapplause Sandy says they've been flexible and optimistic  and they've dealt with all the challenges that have come their way.
nonapplause It's not going to be decided somewhere else.
nonapplause It's why we've made college more affordable  why we're reforming education.
nonapplause And it's safe to say tonight that we have the largest gathering of geneticists and IT experts ever assembled together in the East Room of the White House.
nonapplause Long before women had the right to vote -- long before we even had the right to vote -- or own property  before America even existed  women were serving this country -- facing danger  risking their lives  even dressing up like men so they'd be allowed to serve.
nonapplause Thank you very much  Secretary West  for your eloquent remarks and your leadership and your many years of devotion to our country.
nonapplause I just want to let you know.
nonapplause "Well  we're going to pass more laws against having these guns."
nonapplause I mean  we react against that more than we would if that same child were a robust healthy individual capable of defending himself  and in the midst of an equal battle and fight  one of them happens to get their block knocked off.
nonapplause When I was born late one afternoon  October 8th  in Greenville  South Carolina  no writers asked my mother her name.
nonapplause The House resolution was nonbinding -- just a statement expressing the views of the members.
nonapplause Well  our foreign policies are based on this principle and directed toward this end.
nonapplause We must answer here three fundamental questions: First  how do we make the American Dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are willing to work for it?
nonapplause The other big issue that I think we as Democrats ought to be proud to embrace is the idea that we will draw strength from our diversity.
nonapplause And together  with people like you  that's what we want to do again.
nonapplause And in the responsibility society  each of us is responsible for loving a neighbor just like we would like to be loved ourself.
nonapplause That could create hundreds of thousands of new environmentally-based jobs.
nonapplause I'm grateful for that.
nonapplause Now  my view is we ought to take most of this surplus the next 15 years  and reform and save Medicare  run Social Security's life out to about 2053 -- that ought to take care of all the baby boomers; I'm the oldest of the baby boomers.
nonapplause That's why we're here.
nonapplause Today  we have new evidence that confirms what many have long suspected  and that is that hate crimes are under-reported.
nonapplause It is not a lack of money  and it is not a lack of programs.
nonapplause And then last year he came up with a bill that he called also to give us more freedom—which also wasn't to do that.
nonapplause But there remains some structural changes  some structural fixes  to this extraordinary system that we've got that we're going to have to undertake.
nonapplause And I realize that that's easier said than done.
nonapplause The truth was something far different.
nonapplause It has remained close to its roots and has inspired a commitment to service from all people.
nonapplause When our youngest daughter  Sasha  was diagnosed with meningitis when she was just three months old  it was one of the scariest moments of my life.
nonapplause That could make a big difference.
nonapplause ﻿  Clinton Global Initiative Workshop Summation and Action Plan Plenary
nonapplause But there's unity.
nonapplause And the ravages of postwar trauma were felt even more heavily on their families and in their lives.
nonapplause Both colluded to create that monstrosity the WTO.
nonapplause So Pozen's idea is that we need to modify the formula.
nonapplause If you want America to do well  we have to continue to do better in making our streets safer and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and away from children.
nonapplause The Democrats will support that.
nonapplause The second big issue: One of the major contributions of the Democrats in Congress to this balanced budget agreement was the biggest expansion in health care for children since Medicaid was enacted in 1965 -- $24 billion to provide enough money to insure 5 million more children in America  and almost all of them in working families who don't have health insurance.
nonapplause If you can book dinner on Open Table  or a flight on Southwest or United online  then why shouldn't you be able to make an appointment at your local Social Security office the same way?
nonapplause Mr.
nonapplause I am asking you to do this because you can.
nonapplause If we do not make tax relief permanent  the taxes on a family of four with $40 000 in income will go up $922 a year in the year 2005.
nonapplause We must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise.
nonapplause Now here are the facts.
nonapplause Don't be shy.
nonapplause So  should I turn you loose right now or pick up another collection?
nonapplause And this time  I can claim the best of both worlds: a California homecoming and a reunion with my fellow members of the Commonwealth Club -- all wrapped up in one.
nonapplause I'm getting kind of wound up here  yeah.
nonapplause In Kenya  the government projects that AGOA will create 150 000 new jobs over the next several years; propose new projects  in Lesotho  textiles sectors alone are expected to inject $122 million of investment into that country's economy -- four times the amount of all official development assistance the country received in 1999.
nonapplause And like millions of Americans  we watched that moment on television  and Nancy and I will always remember the way you walked to that microphone and spoke those three simple words -- three words that said everything: "God Bless America."
nonapplause He also got a job where he could keep the title “Mr.
nonapplause So we know we need better standards  and we know we need excellent teachers.
nonapplause These rockets impress people.
nonapplause Those loans have been paid back several times with interest over and over again.
nonapplause Pat Buchanan is that voice  for all the people in America!
nonapplause The block grant program in our package is the first step.
nonapplause At a time when the Mexican government has so courageously taken on the drug cartels that have plagued both sides of the borders  it is absolutely critical that the United States joins as a full partner in dealing with this issue  both through initiatives like the Merida Initiative  but also on our side of the border  in dealing with the flow of guns and cash south.
nonapplause So  in the next few days when you hear that other side saying those things  just hold your nose and smile --   -- because you now have the truth.
nonapplause If the judges say  "This is what it says " you can go look!
nonapplause What they know is that when Jerry Ford left the Presidency the interest rate  the prime rate was 6\1/4\ percent  and when Mr. Mondale left office it was 21\1/2\ percent  the highest in 120 years.
nonapplause Only four Senators voted for the use of force and against the resources our men and women in uniform needed once they were in combat.
nonapplause It's a budget that grows by 4 percent in the discretionary side of things.
nonapplause Our economic program proceeded from a basic understanding of government's responsibilities.
nonapplause This means keeping American companies competitive by opening markets abroad and preparing our
nonapplause Think about it this way.
nonapplause We've all heard these stories.
nonapplause The Department of Trade has been lightening the obligations of reporting and accountancy on small businesses.
nonapplause It's important for our country to be a nation that honors -- that respects other people's opinions.
nonapplause Lost productivity in small businesses  people really insecure about changing jobs because they've had someone in their family sick and they know if they change jobs that pre-existing condition will keep them from getting new health insurance.
nonapplause And my pledge to you is I'm going to continue to work to bring about more progress so every child can have a chance to realize the great promise of a country.
nonapplause They've had three assassination attempts now  I believe  on President Musharraf in Pakistan within the last year.

nonapplause Mr. Nixon says he does  too.
nonapplause I worked in the White House at the side of Gerald Ford  a great American who grew up right here in Grand Rapids.
nonapplause Crime: Crime was a big part of the New Covenant  a big part of why I ran for President.
nonapplause The most recent election had a voter turnout of more than 70 percent  as Iraqis defied the killers and the car-bombers and went to the polls in huge numbers.
nonapplause Instead  it has worked to shirk those obligations: withholding evidence about its weapons capability; threatening  harassing  blocking the inspectors; massing troops on the Kuwaiti border in the South; attacking the Kurds in the North.
nonapplause That's always the first test.
nonapplause I appreciate it.
nonapplause Hamilton made that argument in Federalist 78.
nonapplause The unemployment rate there is 72 percent.
nonapplause If you're a mother planning to go to work  but you're afraid you don't have the skills to get a good job  you can go to college.
nonapplause I hope that your presence here today assures you that we do not take the Hispanic community for granted.
nonapplause Many skilled and determined military personnel are on the hunt -- and one by one  we will bring the terrorists to justice.
nonapplause How appropriate it seemed  5 years later  when the British band played at Yorktown  "The World Turned Upside Down."
nonapplause And these statistics are unacceptable for any of us  for any child in any community.
nonapplause In Lebanon  one of the things that has given heart to the Lebanese people in the street in overthrowing the Lebanese government and telling the Syrians to get out of their country  is that America's call for Lebanese interdependence has been immeasurably strengthened by the fact that France is with us  not at odds with us.
nonapplause We must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world  a world that borders on our doors.
nonapplause The last thing I'd like to talk about briefly is health care -- for a couple of reasons.
nonapplause After all  I had gotten nominated  and I figured we had a few months to fix it.
nonapplause And we need to take this whole effort to a different level.
nonapplause She described her days there as very “unfair” and “difficult.” She said there were days there “that made us feel meaningless.” But she also said there were days “…where I felt I could change the world.” And that trip made her realize she wanted to be a doctor.
nonapplause There were record bank failures; record farm foreclosures; record business bankruptcies; record budget deficits; record trade deficits.
nonapplause I'd say at least ten of them passed  restoring the traditional definition of marriage.
nonapplause Here in Colorado you have young people working to keep kids out of gangs  to teach adults to read  to renovate vacant houses for working families  to clean up parks for children to play in -- and in return  earning some money to go to school.
nonapplause In two years it became law  and proved once again that the right cause can unite us.
nonapplause And in many ways  of course we do.
nonapplause I thank Bobby Whitefeather for the invocation; it was very moving.
nonapplause He took the boy's hand and said  "Never mind  son  we'll ride it down together."
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at the San Gennaro Festival in Flemington  New Jersey
nonapplause We know these things to be true.
nonapplause And then we'd have some sliding combination of both between the upper end and the lower end -- a progressive way to index benefit levels going forward.
nonapplause She's been a big-city prosecutor and a corporate litigator.
nonapplause Today I asked the United States Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  first advocated by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy  first signed by the United States.
nonapplause I think it is very  very important.
nonapplause And we're about to have a balanced budget and a surplus for the first time in 29 years.
nonapplause If you look at all that good and all those storm clouds  we've got to work out a new agreement with other wealthy countries about how we're going to continue to expand trade and how it's going to work in a way that lifts the lives of people everywhere.
nonapplause A career criminal with a semi-automatic gun was terrorizing pedestrians.
nonapplause Well  there are a lot of people who don't trust the government in America to do anything.
nonapplause When I left office we had enough money in surplus to make Social Security good without any changes till 2052— almost the end of the life expectancy of all but the most fortunate baby boomers.
nonapplause Again  I say  restoring growth in Japan and restoring growth in Asia need to be seen as interlocking objectives.
nonapplause We've got to eliminate food deserts and make sure that there are more grocery stores and farmers markets in communities.
nonapplause I know you folks here in Michigan have had your fill of politicians insisting that what you need is another tax increase.
nonapplause Yes  we are in a painful recession.
nonapplause 'Cause I remember going talking to one of his aides  and he said  "well  what if the sheriff should do X  Y  or Z?"
nonapplause And I've seen enough to know that your generation is really something special.
nonapplause The Farmers Home Administration will permit a deferral for 5 years of up to 25 percent of the principal and interest payments owed by farmers who need breathing room to return to a sound financial footing.
nonapplause Two  you ought to have a right to emergency room care in emergency conditions where the nearest emergency room is.
nonapplause Lots of good examples  like up in Hernando  Mayor Chip Johnson is working to build more sidewalks and to bring weekly farmer's markets to town so folks in his town can be more active and eat better.
nonapplause Two thousand years ago  Demosthenes in his address to the Athenians  at the time of the invasion of Philip of Macedonia  said  "Our trouble is from those who would please us rather than those who would serve us."
nonapplause We've failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy.
nonapplause There were nine people in black robes on it  and Mr. Perot was on it  and Diana Ross was on it.
nonapplause I'd just like to mention a couple of other issues  if I might.
nonapplause The enemy that struck on 9/11 is weakened and fractured  yet still lethal  still determined to hit us again.
nonapplause Somebody tells you different they're probably running for office.
nonapplause But  once again  these are measures that have been held up by the liberal leadership in the Congress and  once again  we're going to need your help to get them moving: first  tuition tax credits for the parents of parochial or independent school children; second  the Federal enterprise zones bill that will provide jobs and opportunity for those in our inner cities; and third  a youth employment opportunity wage so that young people  especially minority youngsters  can get that first job they need to begin their climb up the economic ladder.
nonapplause I wouldn't be here if I really believed that that is true.
nonapplause I'd like to talk tonight a little bit about the economy and about the economic strategy we have followed and the one we propose to follow.
nonapplause Yesterday  the Vice President brought to me an interim report on energy -- we've got a problem with energy in America.
nonapplause We're going to explode the deficit.
nonapplause Let me finally say this -- I know there is going to be a lot of debate in this election about the tax cut proposal that the other side has made  and it sounds good.
nonapplause Their Advocacy Center has assisted American companies competing for export opportunities  supporting $11.4 billion in exports and an estimated 70 000 jobs.
nonapplause America is proud of all the men and women serving and sacrificing in this cause - and they will have all the resources they need to complete the vital work that we've asked them to do.
nonapplause Don and our team are not trying to create more jobs for the bureaucracy in Washington; we want more jobs created by a thriving private sector right here in Oklahoma.
nonapplause We're increasing support to veterans in rural areas  with the transportation and housing they need to reach VA hospitals and clinics.
nonapplause The 442 names you just heard belong to men and women of uncommon valor and decency and honor.
nonapplause It calls on us to develop a new strategy for how we're going to deal with it and defeat.
nonapplause We'll have some consumers here of health savings accounts that will describe how they work and whether or not they're working worth a darn.
nonapplause What contribution can we make to the cause of freedom here in the United States  and the cause of freedom around the world?
nonapplause Basically the Democrats registered more new voters and voted them  but the Republicans did a better job of turning out their previously registered voters than the Democrats.
nonapplause They may join before God.
nonapplause Franklin Roosevelt said in his first inaugural  "This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."
nonapplause And they love America deeply  because they know the cost of freedom  and they know the names and faces of men and women who paid for it.
nonapplause And theirs doesn't match that.
nonapplause I want to say a little bit more about the Democratic Party at the end of my remarks  but I'd like to say a couple of words about our leaders  Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle.
nonapplause And it's really because of people like all of you and the folks who came before you  those folks who organized and mobilized and stood up and spoke out  determined to give their daughters and granddaughters opportunities they never dreamed of themselves.
nonapplause So make sure you listen to your teachers.
nonapplause I am very grateful to you and to UNIFEM and to the Noel Foundation for this honour and particularly glad to receive it at the hands of David Rockefeller  who I know has for years devoted so much of his own time to public work and good causes everywhere.
nonapplause I don't think it's revealing classified information to point out that Don has an intensity about him.
nonapplause The NASCAR owners  the crew members  and the executives of this fine sport.
nonapplause I want to talk about another idea that Congress needs to seriously consider.
nonapplause In books like  "Gideon's Trumpet " he has deepened our understanding of freedom of speech  and our continuing battle for civil rights.
nonapplause And so  he gave it to me and I read it again.
nonapplause There are real problems in our country.
nonapplause But I hope we can go beyond it.
nonapplause Fortunately  now  leaders and clerics and private citizens are stepping forward and taking to the streets and calling this evil by its name.
nonapplause You listen to the rhetoric  and he's winning support  and everybody thinks he's a wonderful fella.
nonapplause We are breaking new ground in education  developing a system of lifetime learning  helping the young people who don't go on to college but do need further training; lowering the cost of college loans and stringing out the repayments  but toughening the collection procedures  so that we can open the doors of college education to every one.
nonapplause Education is the answer that will bring hope to those kids who really haven't had hope and opportunity before.
nonapplause I said during the primaries that if I won in West Virginia  I could win the nomination  and there isn't any doubt here that our success here in this primary and the generous support given by the people of West Virginia on that occasion made it possible for us to go to the convention in a position of strength.
nonapplause Among the items Dr. Kay and his team have already identified are the following: a clandestine network of laboratories and safe houses within the Iraqi intelligence service that contained equipment suitable for continuing chemical and biological weapons research; a prison laboratory complex  possibly used in human testing of biological weapons agents  that Iraqi officials were explicitly ordered not to declare to the United Nations; reference strains of biological organisms  concealed in a scientist's home  one of which can be used to produce biological weapons; new research on BW-applicable agents  Brucella and Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever  and continuing work on ricin and aflatoxin  which has not been declared to the United Nations; documents and equipment hidden in scientists' homes that would have been useful in resuming uranium enrichment by centrifuge and electromagnetic isotope separation; a line of unmanned aerial vehicles  not fully declared  and an admission that they had been tested out to a range of 500 kilometers -- 350 kilometers beyond the legal limit imposed by the U.N. after the Gulf War; plans and advanced design work for new long-range ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges capable of striking targets throughout the Middle East  which were prohibited by the U.N. and which Saddam sought to conceal from the U.N. weapons inspectors; clandestine attempts between late 1999 and 2002 to obtain from North Korea technology related to 1 300-kilometer range ballistic missiles  300-kilometer range anti-ship cruise missiles and other prohibited military equipment.
nonapplause Business investment has grown at a healthy rate during the last three years.
nonapplause I'll tell you an interesting story  and it's one that touched my heart.
nonapplause Imagine a country that invests in every child in America where you've learned we should be investing at age three instead of six  where every single qualified -- young man or woman qualified to go to college is able to go to college regardless of their financial circumstances.
nonapplause For example  the Coast Guard has taken on expanded duties to protect our shores and our ports.
nonapplause But we also know that there are thousands more like you in communities throughout this country  large and small  doing their part every single day -- as we speak right now -- in their communities  making them safer but also making the community stronger.
nonapplause But I am here today and I believe you are here today because this time is different.
nonapplause The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking.
nonapplause This torch has been carried by America's best.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause And the truth is  there was talk among a few locals about outsiders coming in.
nonapplause Now  when it comes to the economy  I said that in today's world we're being pushed as never before.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President in Honor of the WNBA Champion Phoenix Mercury
nonapplause So  standards and assessments  that's the first measure; are we doing that well?
nonapplause I am just delighted to be here.
nonapplause The element of isolationism that I see coming into some of our foreign policy debates is equally present in the NAFTA debate: "I've got to worry about myself  and I don't have time to worry about anybody else."
nonapplause It is ironic that some of the modern apostles of apathy now misappropriate Dr. King's own words to support their assertion that the struggle for justice in which he led us nearly over  that the time has come for our policies to be  in their phrase "color blind."
nonapplause In a sense  of course  every election is important.
nonapplause We're also living longer.
nonapplause There are more homeless.
nonapplause The problem is  we have another culture in our country  that I think has gotten confused about its objectives.
nonapplause I think we need to know how we're doing based on a common standard.
nonapplause But we must remember  that our opponents in the world have said over and over again  particularly those represented by Mr. Khrushchev and his wing of the Communist movement  that they do not have to conquer the world by arms  that they are satisfied to do it by other means.
nonapplause It relies upon terror and oppression  a controlled press and radio  fixed elections  and the suppression of personal freedoms.
nonapplause And if you were one of them  thank you.
nonapplause The CEOs and national leaders I have traveled with  we've heard it every stop: look  we just need a chance; our kids need education  our adults need training  and we need somebody who believes in us enough to give us a chance.
nonapplause So I was blasted all over Ireland.
nonapplause During the coming election  we cannot let the legacy of the big spenders and big taxers be forgotten.

nonapplause He's a man who will say and do anything if he thinks it will advance his cause.
nonapplause And today he wants to raise taxes the equivalent of almost $2 000 a household.
nonapplause And I say we have to do more  because if the United States is not prepared to realize its potential to the fullest  to have the best educational system in the world  to give our citizens their equal constitutional rights  to move ahead as a vital and strong economy  then this country is not going to be able to sustain itself and will not serve as the chief defender of freedom around the world.

nonapplause Al Gore says  vote for me and I'll build on that.
nonapplause You see  what we believe is that every child in America can learn.
nonapplause But the problem is you've got these kids that are just pouring out of a lot of these schools.
nonapplause Over time  we will extend this partnership as broadly as possible to keep the world's most destructive weapons away from our shores and out of the hands of our common enemies.
nonapplause And it's something that I hope not only other colleges and universities will look at  but our school systems as well.
nonapplause Over the course of the last four years  I think people have seen very clearly the character and the vision of our President.
nonapplause And they're making our nation more vibrant and more hopeful every day.
nonapplause But we won over 50 percent of the vote in the straw poll  at a time when we were running fifth in the national polls.
nonapplause I will.

nonapplause And I know it hasn't been easy.
nonapplause If you did everything you could from a defensive standpoint and were successful 99 percent of the time  a 1 percent failure rate could be devastating from the standpoint of the country.
nonapplause If you look at education  everybody says they're for education now.
nonapplause But that also means  that  though we sometimes we think otherwise  the great debate about our respect for God's gift of life and His principle of equal justice for all humanity -- that great debate is not the one that takes place on the television screen between this one and that one in politics  and it's not the one that takes place in the courtrooms  before the black-robed judges who try to pretend that their voice is the voice of God in America.
nonapplause And every day for eight years  in my little private office  right off the Oval Office  every single day for eight years  I have looked at the picture of Hillary and me standing with the confetti  the green confetti  coming down in the lobby of this grand old hotel  on St. Patrick's Day.
nonapplause And there are a lot of men who are out of work and wrestling with the shame and frustration that comes when you feel like you can't be the kind of provider you want to be for the people that you love.

nonapplause He acknowledged it's there.
nonapplause New Yorkers opened their homes to evacuated neighbors.
nonapplause Our job is to make sure that government policies are geared to protecting and nurturing our most precious natural resource: our children.
nonapplause It's a future of peace through strength  and prosperity through liberty  personified by the man I believe will be the next President of the United States: George Bush.
nonapplause There is a bust here in San Antonio of that great man Benito Juarez  one of the heroes of the battle that had gone on for Mexican independence.
nonapplause This hemisphere is the neighborhood we live in  and as the president has said  the best foreign policy begins with making sure your own neighborhood is free and democratic and peaceful.
nonapplause With a solid bipartisan majority  we delivered the most dramatic education reforms in a generation.
nonapplause And of course  there have always been and continue to be environmental concerns  but we've done a lot in terms of cleaning up our coal-burning facilities.
nonapplause I say that to those of you who saw the accounts over the weekend -- I'm telling you  these are very impressive people on these negotiating teams  they're very impressive people.
nonapplause Without going into any detail  in the hopes that that's what will be discussed tomorrow.
nonapplause And so  I think  you know  that's enough to rest our case.
nonapplause The mission of the United States military to have a fighting forces trained and prepared to fight war  and therefore  prevent war from happening in the first place.
nonapplause Are you... Have you no doubts?"
nonapplause Consumer confidence is at its highest level in two years  and 1.5 million jobs have been created in the last 11 months.
nonapplause Crime is dropping because whole communities  like Boston  are taking responsibility for their streets and their neighborhoods and because government is giving them the support they need.
nonapplause The obvious answer is a commitment to clean  new jobs.

nonapplause And she said  right  and now he'd be Vice President of the United States.
nonapplause That requires going forward  together  with a shared vision of the future that our military families deserve.

nonapplause Well  thank God those days are over.
nonapplause You all make us so very proud of this country.
nonapplause Governor Romer  thank you.
nonapplause It's why this celebration tonight benefits the Children's National Medical Center and all the children whose lives they touch and they save.
nonapplause Don't be afraid to reach across party lines and ask Democrats and independents who appreciate strong leadership.
nonapplause I think that's an accurate statement.
nonapplause We are going to have to make sure that we pass on to our children a country which is using natural resources given to us by the Lord to the maximum; that every drop of water that flows to the ocean first serves a useful and beneficial purpose; that the resources of the land are used  whether it is agriculture or whether it is oil or minerals; that we move ahead here in the West and move ahead here in the United States.
nonapplause And if it persists  the pressure will continue to mount  and its isolation will continue to deepen.
nonapplause I think these lessons have to guide any effort  now or in the future  to reach a comprehensive peace.
nonapplause When I'm in the presence of such greatness  how can I feel intimidated by a little challenge like running for President?
nonapplause And it's a chance to sit down  have a cup of coffee and talk about the issues of the day.
nonapplause The optimism I sense here  this optimism is something I've felt all over this country.

nonapplause Welcome to the White House.
nonapplause We shall reduce the present rates of direct taxation providing employees and businessmen alike with the incentives that they have lacked during these last four years.
nonapplause What Montesquieu called   -- the loss of anything that protects us from the invasion of an utterly reckless and abusive power.
nonapplause Last Autumn  you will remember Mr Callaghan  after an agony of indecision drew back from the brink  a prime example—a Prime Ministerial example—of deciding that discretion was the better part of voting.
nonapplause Well  my dream for America -- and I know it's one you share -- is to be the kind of success story that this valley has -- see that story multiply a million times.

nonapplause Through its leadership role as America's National Ballet Company  ABT's education programs reach over 25 000 students in some of the most underserved communities and schools across the nation.

nonapplause Part of Martin Luther King's dream was that somehow we would learn to "work together  pray together  struggle together  go to jail together  stand up for freedom together."
nonapplause I should like -- as I do that  I should like in closing  to call to mind that when Greece  a few years later  rose up in 1821  that was in part inspired by the declaration of the American Revolution of independence in 1776.
nonapplause The problem  of course  is that Blackmun approached it the way  I don't know  a sophomore in some college class might approach it  instead of sitting down and actually reading the Constitution and seeing what was said.
nonapplause But what can the parents do if it takes 25 percent of their income -- not enough  at any rate  to pay the expenses to be in a proper child care facility.
nonapplause Thirdly  benefits promised to people like me are dramatically higher than benefits given to today's retirees.
nonapplause We believe that it's not law unless it has been done in accordance with the key principle of legitimate government  which is that it must be based upon consent  and that those laws must be therefore made by constitutional means that result in a representative decision on behalf of the people.
nonapplause With allies at our side  we took down the regime and destroyed the al Qaeda camps.
nonapplause So we have to find another way to come back and convince the American people we are not going to have the government take over health care  but we do think every American who goes to work should know they're not going to lose their health care  they can keep what they've got.
nonapplause I was going to ask if I could count on you  but you've already given me that answer.
nonapplause Yet as we get farther away from September 11th  2001  some in Washington are yielding to the temptation to downplay the threat  and to back away from the business at hand.
nonapplause We all like watching Mickey work.
nonapplause They were nominated by the presidents of their colleges and selected by a distinguished panel of leaders in higher education.
nonapplause For businesses with fewer than 20 employees  the cost of compliance is estimated at nearly $7 000 per worker.
nonapplause You know  the United States has engaged in three wars in this century  and in those wars in no case have we gotten an acre of territory; in no case have we gotten any concessions; all we have fought for is the right of other people to be free  and for ourselves  of course in the process  to be free.
nonapplause Finally  think of what Margaret Thatcher meant to the world.
nonapplause The Constitution wouldn't be what it is without James Madison's religious values.
nonapplause We're working to restore our nation's parents  State and local officials  teachers  school administrators  and principals to their rightful place in the educational process.
nonapplause A month to the day before he died  he wrote me a letter about Russia  which remains perhaps the most eloquent and lucid foreign policy document I received in eight years as President.
nonapplause The state's response is needed and necessary.
nonapplause I know that in addition to regular subjects  you guys also specialize in different arts such as music and dance  literature and design.
nonapplause But you'll have to give me a rain check.
nonapplause And we're addressing this crisis in four parts: First  a recovery package.
nonapplause Under Labour the British Army would be without them.
nonapplause It was a smart thing to do  Governor  and I appreciate you doing it.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President in Rio Rancho Town Hall on Credit Card Reform
nonapplause The very important question today is whether  on five years' reflection  we have yet learned all the lessons from 9/11.
nonapplause To the future that beckons all of us.
nonapplause Marxist Socialism is not yet buried but its epitaph can now be written.
nonapplause Many skeptics will look at all proposed reform measures and ask whether they'll work and whether there will be unintended consequences.
nonapplause We ought to invest in education  in the things we know that work -- and recognize that the poorest children in this country need the richest education if we're going to have the kind of future we want.
nonapplause All are part of our vision.
nonapplause That's what the Founders knew  and that's what we all know when there's a tsunami.
nonapplause I know that you know this.
nonapplause They called the American experiment a "new order of the ages."
nonapplause And Madeleine Albright – I can't claim credit for this – she had best one-line description of it.
nonapplause Nigerians have shown us that democracy is a necessity  especially when times are hard.
nonapplause And it was just an argument  but the American people decided to give us a chance -- probably  frankly  because the country was in such tough shape.
nonapplause I'm sure you've all heard and possibly used yourself in a speech as I have his statement that if we look to Washington to find out "when to sow and when to reap  we shall soon want for bread."
nonapplause Good morning.
nonapplause We need to do more research to see how we can reverse some of this pollution.
nonapplause Can you answer?
nonapplause See  with this diploma  this education  the doors of opportunity are so open wide to you.
nonapplause They have done very well in the new global economy.
nonapplause But we also have to acknowledge the limits of this plan.
nonapplause I was on that ride.
nonapplause And I want to tell you that my generation and a few generations between mine and yours --   -- we have a sacred trust.
nonapplause Even money abroad  we don't have enough money domestically to finance the debt  so we are now borrowing money abroad  from foreign banks  governments and financial institutions: $40 billion in 1983; $70-80 billion in 1984 (40 percent of our total); and over $100 billion (50 percent of our total) in 1985.
nonapplause Here in Trinidad and Tobago  we must respect those differences while celebrating those things that we share in common.
nonapplause All over the world there are people who spend day after day after day after day in abject misery because they are in the grip of a destructive obsession where they define the merit of their life by their ability to -- hopefully  in their minds -- repress somebody who is of a different racial  religious  ethnic  or tribal group.
nonapplause Well now  ladies and gentlemen of the American Bar  there is a non-Soviet word for that kind of talk.
nonapplause The next big issue I believe is the balancing of economic growth and environmental protection.
nonapplause But bitter  old divisions are falling away.
nonapplause Makes you wonder  can't anything in Washington ever be simple?
nonapplause Seemingly secure jobs have been lost.
nonapplause Thank you and God bless you.
nonapplause Second  we must make certain that nuclear weapons will continue to be available for the defense of the entire Treaty area  and that these weapons are at all times under close and flexible political control that meets the needs of all the NATO countries.
nonapplause It also means that a lot of Americans are at risk of losing their health insurance all the time.
nonapplause Keep your spirits up.
nonapplause I do not want to see the government close because of snow again.
nonapplause We're pulling the Republican lever."
nonapplause I have actually visited Japan many times.
nonapplause But America is back -- a giant on the scene  powerful in its renewed spirit  powerful in its growing economy  and powerful in its ability to defend itself and secure the peace.
nonapplause That's heresy in our times  so I won't go there.
nonapplause If we can lead a revolution in technology  push back the frontiers of space  then we can provide our workers in industries old and new all that they need to out-produce -- and I've said this many times -- give the American workers the tools they need and they will out-produce  out-compete  and out-sell anybody  anytime  anywhere in the world.
nonapplause So a middle schooler or a high schooler who mistakenly decides that it's safe to try cocaine or heroine or LSD or methamphetamine or any of the so-called designer drugs  along with marijuana  is playing a dangerous game and we have to try somehow to do more than we have done in the past to stop this.
nonapplause And that's because .
nonapplause The right way to rebuild America's economic security is to invest in our people and to expand trade  not to restrict it.
nonapplause As I understand it  people in my income group have already gotten a $10 000 tax cut under that first tax bill  which is 10 times as much as the average American will get when it's all phased in.
nonapplause I was a cosponsor of it the second time and a cosponsor the third time.
nonapplause Hello  everybody.
nonapplause I know you realize that sometimes in the business of working in our politics in America today  you can kind of start to feel like you're a little bit crazy and isolated--especially if you've spent too much time reading the newspapers or watching TV--but I have the refreshing experience of coming back to Utah and finding that there is still a decent heart in America  and still a some common sense in America  and still a faith in America that can  I hope  revive our spirits and our will and save this country.
nonapplause They're wrong about it.
nonapplause Third.
nonapplause He jumped onto the track  and he pulled the man into a space between the rails  and he held him as a train went right over them.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause Part of the reasons I wanted to come here today  to one of our top military educational institutions  in the company of our military leadership  is to bring home to the American people the extraordinary service of our military men and women  and all they do to protect our nation and bear the burden of our global leadership.
nonapplause Let me tell you something.
nonapplause In the last 6 years  $21 billion.
nonapplause We have stood firm.
nonapplause And every nation has it.
nonapplause We see America -- or he sees America divided by envy  each of us challenging our neighbor's success; we see an America inspired and uniting for opportunity  all of us challenging the best in ourselves.
nonapplause What must the media do?
nonapplause Yes  within the health care system  doctors shouldn't perform unnecessary procedures  patients shouldn't bring frivolous malpractice suits  people who use the health care system now  who aren't in it now  are going to have to pay a little for their health care  so they realize there is a price for everything instead of when all of the money just comes from a third party source they don't know.
nonapplause But whether you agree or disagree with the approach of President Bush there  I think all Americans should acknowledge and do acknowledge that when President Bush feels strongly about an issue he can be focused and determined and relentless in pursuing his objective.
nonapplause Portion sizes in this country have ballooned.
nonapplause Now  these zones have created thousands of new jobs.
nonapplause —Action to close down the newly independent State schools  to close down the Grammar schools  to close down the City Technology Colleges.
nonapplause Well  they'll probably come after us more than anybody else just because of who we are and what we believe  but just look at what has transpired around the world since 9/11 with the attacks in Madrid  in Casablanca  in Mombassa  in Istanbul  in Riyadh  in Bali  in Jakarta  and most recently  of course  in Baslan  in Russia  this week where they slaughtered hundreds of school children.
nonapplause And I have kept my word to meet with them and to work with them.
nonapplause I told you earlier we were laying the foundation of peace for generations to come  and we are  because we go with confidence knowing that liberty is the desire of every soul.
nonapplause It's not good for travelers  it's not good for the airline industry  and it's not good for the overall economy.
nonapplause You know  in times past we've had some good economic periods and a lot of communities and individuals and families have been left behind.
nonapplause But let us stretch our imaginations a moment and contemplate the unthinkable.
nonapplause But even in these closing days of my presidency  I can't stop doing my job.
nonapplause Being a citizen of this country comes not only with rights but also with certain fundamental responsibilities.
nonapplause So I want to take some time to recognize some of the members of this family  some of your colleagues who are on stage with me today -- people who have devoted huge portions of their career to this agency.
nonapplause So let's think about that.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at Hud Homeownership Event
nonapplause And that's why I made it very clear: America seeks a prosperous Russia that partners with us on a broad range of issues.
nonapplause Russia  once our nuclear adversary  is now our partner in reducing the nuclear threat and in expanding democracy -- ancient animosities in the Middle East are yielding to the promise of peace -- a transformation made tangible to billions of people last month in a simple stunning handshake.
nonapplause We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control  and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare.
nonapplause They had one of the most highly developed governmental systems  tax systems  cultures  period  at that time when people in Europe—
nonapplause When you strip away all the details and all the rhetoric  that is what we are trying to do.
nonapplause It is indeed a struggle for this nation's soul and future.
nonapplause If you look at me  you can see that I come from those people in America whose ancestors were at one time held in slavery.
nonapplause What we must not do in the face of a mortal threat is give in to wishful thinking or willful blindness.
nonapplause He was once the youngest man in the Senate for quite a long time.
nonapplause The real issue is whether we will have the wisdom and the courage to see our common ground and walk on it.
nonapplause Now  I've looked carefully at John Kerry's record and let me say today  as I've said -- I said it in my speech at the convention in New York a few weeks ago -- that we respect John Kerry's military service  as we do for all of our veterans  appreciate very much his service in Vietnam.
nonapplause This is  of course  one of the very newest congressional districts in the nation.
nonapplause This is a remarkable assemblage  and I want to thank Hillary and Secretary Albright and all the others who have worked so hard to put this meeting together today.
nonapplause With better governance  I have no doubt that Africa holds the promise of a broader base of prosperity.
nonapplause And so we have to save some of this money  because we need to invest in our future because we don't have it yet.
nonapplause If left unchecked  the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans.
nonapplause 35% of the land mass of the oldest democracy in Latin America  Columbia  is dominated by the narco-traffickers and their terrorist supporters.
nonapplause No question in my mind these are tough times for America.
nonapplause We're an optimistic country  confident in ourselves  and in ideals bigger than ourselves.
nonapplause But I was happy when she decided to do this  because I think it's important that we have people in the Senate who understand these big issues and understand the big choices  and who are capable of clarifying them  number one.
nonapplause Tom and I worry about how to raise standards  how to improve the equality of education.
nonapplause The reality is that terrorists were at war with our country long before the liberation of Iraq  and long before the attacks of 9/11.
nonapplause I have never heard anyone tell of any difference between these corrupt capitalist parties.
nonapplause You had the quarterback make an important tackle  and you had yourself a receiver make an important pass.
nonapplause I wish that Cesar Chavez could be here today.
nonapplause I know it was painful around here earlier this year  when three shifts at this plant were cut down to one.
nonapplause From hurt to hope  from darkness to light  the line of progress is unbroken.
nonapplause That flag doesn't belong to any president.
nonapplause But we talked about this.
nonapplause Well  it was a good thing for me to promise  but a very bad thing for Roosevelt to promise  because the unemployment rate of the country was 25 percent.
nonapplause It is a sight to see.
nonapplause We took the first big step toward welfare reform by giving income tax relief to 15 million families that hover right around the poverty line  even though the people work full-time  so that there would never be any more incentive to leave work and go on welfare  so that all the incentives would be the other way around and we would reward work and family.
nonapplause We'll increase AmeriCorps by 50 percent.
nonapplause My opponent's understanding of economics is well described by his predictions.
nonapplause That's why we've set a goal of doubling –- and that's doubling –- the number of schools that participate in the Healthier U.S. School Challenge by June of 2011.
nonapplause He's got the experience and the qualifications to do the job.
nonapplause Now what does that mean?
nonapplause I appreciate General Conway.
nonapplause The second thing is  what we do does work now.
nonapplause But it's also exactly when I'd want to be in Washington  because I think we have the opportunity to make such a difference for so many people who need that help right now.
nonapplause Again  let me remind you that while this 30-percent reduction will leave the taxpayers with $500 billion more in their pockets over the next 5 years  it's actually only a reduction in the tax increase already built into the system.
nonapplause For example  you all applauded when I said more than half the people in the world live under governments of their own choosing for the first time in history.
nonapplause I also want to make this tax code more fair.
nonapplause If it hadn't been for the members of Congress here who have helped me  I couldn't have done it.
nonapplause They relish class division.
nonapplause before him and John Kennedy after him -- in strength abroad and self-reliance at home.
nonapplause Only 12 members of the United States Senate opposed the funding that would provide vital resources for our troops.
nonapplause The work goes on  because we are dealing with an enemy that views the entire world as the battlefield.
nonapplause During the course of this campaign  we've seen something quite different in the President's opponent.
nonapplause Let me assure you that in both the START and INF talks  we want to hear Soviet proposals; we want them to hear our own; and we're prepared to negotiate tomorrow if the Soviets so choose.
nonapplause But when their currencies drop precipitously  the prices of their goods fall  they could undercut the sales of our own goods here at home that are otherwise profitable  dramatically increasing our trade deficit under circumstances that could cause the American people to turn away from open trade toward protectionism in a way that has terrific negative consequences long-term for our global growth objectives.
nonapplause Yes  times are tough.
nonapplause We need it all.
nonapplause The outcome of this election will depend upon whether the American people believe what I just said  that it's a big election with big challenges and not a time to lay down and relax.
nonapplause They have never been for the same thing  ever.
nonapplause It was the beginning of a serious reform effort  which I tried to carry through and which I know President Bush has tried to push.
nonapplause Because just as the creek bottomland required the farmer's hard work to make it flourish  so this vast and beautiful land that God has given us requires our diligence to keep it great.
nonapplause We quadrupled the debt of this country in 12 years.
nonapplause The only news subject I'm touching on right now is the subject of good education.
nonapplause I believe we can do more to help people succeed at home and at work.
nonapplause And in large measure  because of your common efforts  it is now generally agreed that we have the finest system of higher education anywhere in the world.
nonapplause I am reminded of the story Abraham Lincoln told about a guy who comes to the White House  insists on seeing the President.
nonapplause So you see  that is the strength and the spirit and courage that our military families display every day.
nonapplause I say wherever cost effective  because I don't want the manufacturers of the new products to feel that they've got an easy market when it comes to the federal government.
nonapplause Throughout our military  intelligence has a daily  indeed hourly  influence on the movement of ships and subs  fighter and bomber missions  and orders given to those commands at the tip of the spear.
nonapplause And you have been very strong allies of our administration and good partners in those endeavors  and I thank you for that very much.
nonapplause That's why we reduced interest rates so dramatically.
nonapplause And you ought to read the glowing statements made by such Democratic sympathizers as Dick Armey.
nonapplause I think it's a noble life.
nonapplause And we were struggling even to keep our rural banks alive and keep them in a position where they could finance farms.
nonapplause That is why we have to act with care as we make needed repairs to the program occasioned by the huge growth in retirees.
nonapplause You know  you don't need to be an economist to know that jobs are the engine of our economy.
nonapplause I like to think it was a good investment.
nonapplause Now  this doesn't mean that the recession is over for the millions of Americans who are still out of work  or the millions more who are still struggling to make ends meet.
nonapplause And when I was leaving  I was in the airport walking back to my little plane and this lady starts screaming at me on the tarmac  “Mr.
nonapplause Trade is revolutionary force that wears down the foundations of despotic rule.
nonapplause And the productivity of our farmers are -- it really means we can compete anywhere.
nonapplause We must not raise taxes on men and women who are already taking pay cuts just to keep their jobs.
nonapplause I held in my hand a few days ago a baby  one pound and one ounce  and they'd already given him open-heart surgery.
nonapplause Thirty-five years ago  when President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act -- now more than 35 years ago -- he said  I quote  "It adds to our laws another structure basic to democracy."
nonapplause About the only place left today where you encounter regulations that silly is in the Federal bureaucracy  and we're trying our best to get rid of them there.
nonapplause Next month  Iraqis will vote in free and democratic elections.

nonapplause Under Secretary General Kofi Annan's leadership  the U.N. is reforming itself and responding to many challenges.
nonapplause Unemployment on some of our Indian reservations is still as high as 70 percent.
nonapplause Now  from that statement of principle  you can actually deduce the features of our whole way of life as a free people.
nonapplause Now it is preparing for a new century.
nonapplause I have to beg to differ with those people who think that the human claim to rights comes from the Bill of Rights  or even those that would assert that it comes from the Constitution.
nonapplause And now the economy is stabilizing.
nonapplause And yet  in the midst of war  the lowliest private soldier in our military not only has the right  he is under an obligation to refuse an unlawful order.
nonapplause It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while the typical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2 000.
nonapplause And we got to get out of denial about that and instead  go do it.
nonapplause It's not just an assault on some material object that we won't have anymore.
nonapplause We know how to turn around failing schools now.
nonapplause That is what makes us different.
nonapplause And it's amazing what community spirit comes out during a Net Day.
nonapplause Our efforts to promote peace  however  cannot be limited to defeating violent extremists.
nonapplause You have to try to build   Somebody's got a great song on their cell phone there.
nonapplause That is all it is to the Communists.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the National Italian American Foundation Dinner
nonapplause We've given him high-tech equipment to help the Pakistani forces locate the terrorists attempting to cross the border.
nonapplause The Social Security trust is solvent.
nonapplause We're spending 4% of our GDP  that's over $400 billion dollars a year more than any other country on earth (about $4 000 a family).
nonapplause These are the things that America stands for.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause It was just her words.
nonapplause Well  I've appointed very different Justices to the U.S. Supreme Court  and so will George Bush.
nonapplause That's never happened in the history of the country before.
nonapplause If they had printed it last week  there would have been an outcry  and no one would have allowed the Belgians and the United States  and the others who are in cahoots with each other  to carry on the criminal activity that they did in the Congo  which I doubt anybody in the world  not even here at Oxford  will accept.
nonapplause Nor is the story over.
nonapplause It strives to create a blueprint for building financially sustainable and scalable organizations to deliver affordable  critical goods and services to elevate the lives of the poor.
nonapplause I wish I could just tell you all these stories.
nonapplause In the face of a politics that shut you out  has told you to settle  that's divided us for too long  you believe that we can be one people  reaching out for what's possible  building that more perfect union.
nonapplause Now  none of this is to say that there aren't some serious drawbacks with respect to nuclear energy that have to be addressed.
nonapplause And talk to people about where they are and what their dreams are  what their problems are  and see whether we can get people together.” And it's worked pretty well for her and I think it'll work pretty well for our country.
nonapplause On the trade deficit  even as the stock market was falling a few weeks ago  the latest figures tell us progress is being made in narrowing the trade gap.
nonapplause I saw Chris Dodd the other day on TV.
nonapplause That's something that we just have to remind ourselves.
nonapplause And by doing so  we help create the kind of future that we want for these young people and for all American children.
nonapplause Those not yet captured or killed live in fear  and their fears are well founded.
nonapplause That's what we're trying to combat everywhere else in the world.
nonapplause I also think there has been real progress in the effort to make the recovery for of a bottom-up process.
nonapplause They still thought that perhaps they'd been in the one area of the building hit by a rocket or mortar.
nonapplause In the past two days I've been to Bosnia and to Serbia.
nonapplause Now you tell me we have put up against that juicy  passionate  convicted falsehood a bone-dry heartless representative of truth  and you tell me where we are going to end up.
nonapplause I understand they don't take postcards as seriously as they take letters.
nonapplause And by the time you get down to Jericho fifteen or twenty minutes later  you're about twenty-two hundred feet below sea level.
nonapplause Governor  Senator Durenberger  and Penny  our Congressmen who are here -- Tom Hagedorn  Bill Frenzel  Vin Weber  and Arlan Stangeland -- and an old friend who is right down here in front  known to all of us.
nonapplause We have a chance and an obligation to save Social Security  to reform Medicare  to restore some of the cuts we put in that were excessive two years ago  to add a prescription drug benefit  and to take care of the elderly of this country -- which all of the young people should favor  because it means they won't have to do it  and they'll have the money to raise our grandchildren.
nonapplause America must not return to a mind-set which is rooted in the past.
nonapplause There are a host of problems that were going unchallenged.
nonapplause And so we were talking and she said  I'm really worried about something.
nonapplause And I can assure you  we won't be satisfied till every American who wants a job has a job and is earning a decent living.
nonapplause Secondly  we're going to be working on what can be done to get some more police officers out there in and around the schools  just as we have on the streets.
nonapplause But in dealing with the terrorists themselves  we will be relentless and they will come to understand the meaning of justice.
nonapplause These are the kinds of things we have to do.
nonapplause It's not like there's no test here.
nonapplause And then they go even further: "Well  even if he does win  he won't have the Congress to back him."
nonapplause They don't measure against the facts of what they have done in the past and what the facts of this budget that I have presented are.
nonapplause How sweet it is to say "Governor George Deukmejian."
nonapplause The Rose Revolution  as it's become -- referred to from the outset -- and the voice of the Georgian people were a clarion call to freedom-loving people around the globe -- everyone who loves freedom and democracy  and even more importantly  those who yearn for it  those who yearn for it and do not have it.
nonapplause We're walking across the street together.
nonapplause This is not just a problem for one section.
nonapplause So I'll try to keep my remarks relatively brief  but I do want to focus as much as we can this morning on the Social Security issue.
nonapplause And they coincide in many places.
nonapplause Don Kendall  I have a hunch you knew exactly what you were doing.
nonapplause Nearly half a century later  in a world war  our soldiers fought and died together in places like Bataan and Corregidor.
nonapplause The men and women of the military are rebuilding schools  repairing medical facilities  and training Iraqis to provide security for their fellow citizens.
nonapplause And whether it's technical skills in engineering  logistics  public safety; whether it's leadership skills like team building and performing under intense pressure -- what they've learned standing watch over the homeland and fighting wars abroad is precisely what we need to meet our biggest challenges here at home.
nonapplause We've got the crime rate down to a 25-year low; good -- murder rate down to a 31-year low; good.
nonapplause So we were in difficulty anyway.
nonapplause Don't write that down on a blog.
nonapplause But if you do  we'll keep building our new future of opportunities for America.
nonapplause So to all of you who are young go out there and move the world from interdependence to integration  to a place where we share benefits and responsibilities  a place where we do not give up our distinctive identities but we say our common humanity matters more.
nonapplause We keep them  the wounded who are recovering  and those who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we can live in safety and freedom  we keep them in our thoughts and our prayers every second of the day.
nonapplause I'd say they're tax-and-spend twins.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the Vice President at the Florida State University Commencement Ceremony
nonapplause That's like having a second mortgage  a Mondale mortgage.
nonapplause And it is true of a President.
nonapplause And my friends  the next President deserves better than this  and so do all the American people.
nonapplause You think about that.
nonapplause We see biologists developing techniques to locate a single cancer cell among millions of healthy ones.
nonapplause Now the Soviets have said they've had enough.
nonapplause The only success that matters will be the success that comes when wherever you are  whatever condition you're in  however downcast or however low you may feel  however unworthy you may be  you make bold to lift up your eyes in hope and see in response the loving welcome of God.
nonapplause We must take with us all those we can rouse so that a new possibility is created for America.
nonapplause Wherever you see the Black man  he walks with dignity.
nonapplause We should be confident.
nonapplause And helping families face the challenges of this changing world is at the heart of the President's plan.
nonapplause You heard Christopher Reeve talk at the Democratic Convention about that.
nonapplause I think this is a problem  too.
nonapplause Those policies we put in place then lasted for about the next 40 years  and were supported by Republican and Democratic administrations alike -- the basic  fundamental foundation of national security for the United States really until the Soviet Union collapsed and the Cold War ended in the 1989-90 time frame.
nonapplause Thanks a lot  Mickey.
nonapplause But is that what America is about?
nonapplause Every year we see the effects of this breakdown: budget deadlines delayed or missed completely  monstrous year-end budget busters  and so-called continuing resolutions with billions and billions of dollars for boondoggles and special interest programs.
nonapplause The task in front of us is still urgent.
nonapplause Today we must stand strong  because we are the keepers of that flame.
nonapplause I am here today in the hope that we can together take a different course of action  to offer a new set of challenges to our people.
nonapplause But he handed me the paper  and the paper says  "The wire's gone dead."
nonapplause And this innovation was the idea of Clyde Thurston  an IRS employee who is here today from the IRS office in St. Paul  Minnesota.
nonapplause Well  because the world has changed so much in the last 25 years  Robert Kennedy's words echo every bit as powerfully today as they did then.
nonapplause He provided a home for Abu Nidal  for Palestinian Islamic Jihad  made $25 000 payments to the families of suicide bombers and had a relationship with al Qaeda.
nonapplause And there he was to make contact with one of our spies named Murphy.
nonapplause Because  that border situation requires document checking  you're also dealing with dangerous people who are bringing in drugs and carrying all kinds of automatic weapons.
nonapplause Many of you have known that experience.
nonapplause I believe that the responsibility of our generation of Americans is to build a society here in this country so vital  so vigorous  so effective  that it serves as an example to the world  that it serves as an example to those who wish to decide which road they shall take.
nonapplause Helping people be good parents and good workers makes good sense.
nonapplause So money is a big issue here.
nonapplause But the threat to our global environment is more difficult and we must first get a better assessment of the risk so that we deal with the problem in the right way.
nonapplause The threat that Franklin Roosevelt faced and Harry Truman faced was the threat of military action across national boundaries  the kind of action taken by Hitler in Poland  the kind of action taken by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.
nonapplause We all believe in America's mission.
nonapplause What we do attack is the way that the sacrifices made last year to slow the pace of inflation have once again been wasted: wasted because as soon as the last crisis receded from his mind  Denis Healey went on another spending spree with our money.
nonapplause I've often said that the United States has only one -- and I mean this sincerely -- only one truly sacred obligation.
nonapplause Hello  everybody.
nonapplause Let me thank you most of all for supporting Buddy.
nonapplause You make this a better country and you make us all very proud.
nonapplause When the Northwest Ordinance was signed at the end of the 18th century  which involved Michigan  one out of every 16 acres was put aside for education.
nonapplause It is sometimes tragic for us to realize in thinking of the problems which face us in the 1960's  that one of the great contributions which the United States made to international understanding and good will was the sending of penicillin to cure some of the diseases which inflicted the people of north Africa.
nonapplause It is not hard to see why the terrorists oppose and rage against the rise of democracy in Iraq.
nonapplause Every group in the world with an axe to grind is going to Seattle to demonstrate.
nonapplause Thank you so much.
nonapplause Fourth  to increase and broaden our understanding of ethical issues and clinical research  we commit to providing postgraduate fellowships to train bioethicists especially among African Americans and other minority groups.
nonapplause That's what this TRP  the Technology Reinvestment Project  is all about.
nonapplause Compassion and ingenuity are being put to work all over this country to lift up lives  from the mentoring of children of prisoners to bringing meals and a few minutes of friendly conversation to our elderly neighbors.
nonapplause That's why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.
nonapplause And then it became readily apparent that that didn't really solve any problems.
nonapplause Now  it's been nine years since your last title -– which must have felt like an eternity for Yankees fans.
nonapplause It's a privilege and a responsibility afforded to few generations -- and a task that you're now called to fulfill.
nonapplause He added the rates of unemployment and inflation together and then said of the incumbent President that  "No man had the right to seek reelection as a President who had a misery index of 12.5."
nonapplause One year ago we liberated Grenada from Communist thugs who had taken over that country.
nonapplause Rt.
nonapplause All the tests of the last two-and-a-half years have come to the right nation.
nonapplause Next  I urge the conference to retain provisions that would remove 6 million lower income Americans from the Federal income tax rolls altogether.
nonapplause I did not want the welfare reform bill to be an excuse to hurt children and I vetoed two bills that I thought were.
nonapplause A Family USA report released today shows that the cost of prescription drugs is continuing to increase.
nonapplause He's the kind of Commander I'd like to serve under -- it's just that  he just serves under me.
nonapplause Think of a child who's in a foster home.
nonapplause They made this a place where hard work is the rule  not the exception; a place where bedrock values took root -- faith in a loving God  belief in family  and love of a country that gave them  and you  opportunity  peace  and freedom.
nonapplause Secretary Riley is relocating from South Carolina to Georgia as a result of the outcome of the World Series.
nonapplause And he has been a very good friend to this President for the last eight years.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause Mr. Quincy Jones.
nonapplause What does that budget call for?
nonapplause And the reason wasn't any nobility.
nonapplause So seize it.
nonapplause Abe Lincoln said we must disenthrall ourselves with the past -- and then we will save our country.
nonapplause Don't we want to be able to -- and if we do more to protect our markets from unfair trade practices  then it still means that we're going to have to generate more economic activity here at home.
nonapplause But it is a proud record that you have.
nonapplause With Judge Ginsburg soon to be before the Senate  I am determined to use all the powers at my disposal as President to do just that.
nonapplause I had the honor of being with some of the finest folks in your state  the firefighters and those who work for the police and emergency medical teams  to lay out one of my budget priorities  which is a first responders initiative.
nonapplause This event turned out a little differently than I expected.
nonapplause More on education and training  more on airports  more on roads  more on technology.
nonapplause Across the country  take-home pay is up  and families have more to spend.
nonapplause Even after the attack inside our own country  the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center  there was a tendency to treat terrorist attacks as individual criminal acts to be handled primarily through law enforcement.
nonapplause I appreciate that.
nonapplause I want to express my thanks to you for being kind enough to come down here and for giving me an opportunity to speak to you.
nonapplause The absence of hope can rot a society from within.
nonapplause We must make it clear again that every election is a choice.
nonapplause But the only way we can do this is to work together.
nonapplause The 1984 election isn't just a partisan contest.
nonapplause And it really is true that they say the darndest things.
nonapplause She didn't have the money.
nonapplause And there was a bill passed by the Congress back  I think  in the early '70s  maybe even in the late '60s  where doctors could  in effect  work off their very expensive medical school tuitions if they would go to isolated  rural areas or inner-cities where there were no doctors.
nonapplause They believed in their free speech and mine as well.
nonapplause Shortly into her third pregnancy  Erin's doctor had to stop delivering babies because he couldn't afford his medical liability insurance.
nonapplause However  they agreed that they would resolve all this by September and we were coming up on the deadline.
nonapplause So thank you for your extraordinary work.
nonapplause What America needs is high tech  not high taxes.
nonapplause The power of this bust will not just be in the metal that delineates Sojourner Truth's face; it will also be in the message that defines her legacy.
nonapplause China has its own distinct story that shapes its own worldview.
nonapplause Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.
nonapplause My opponent  Mr. Mondale  offers a government of pessimism  fear  and limits compared to ours of hope  confidence  and growth.
nonapplause And it's your own.
nonapplause That is what is special about Europe and that is what we must gain back.
nonapplause Now  for most seniors  it's much more than that.
nonapplause A line-item veto sure would've come in handy on the highway bill.
nonapplause My predecessor John Adams  who was our first Vice President  he also had floor privileges  and then he could participate in the debate.
nonapplause All of it!
nonapplause One year ago  we saw in stark relief how markets can spin out of control; how a lack of common-sense rules can lead to excess and abuse; how close we can come to the brink.
nonapplause And so I have  and it has been a wonderful life for me.
nonapplause But it's a pleasure to be back in this part of the country.
nonapplause As the economy continues to improve  though  we must not be complacent.
nonapplause Now  what do we have to do to win?
nonapplause They killed campaign finance reform.
nonapplause All three were followed by periods of sustained growth  more jobs  and greater wealth creation across the country.
nonapplause I can only summarize my views very briefly.
nonapplause And that's an important priority of ours -- the health of our citizens.
nonapplause That is the responsibility not of the next President  and not of the next Congress  and not of the House and the Senate - it is a responsibility in which all of us participate  in which all of us share.
nonapplause I want you to consider the state of America's families and the state of America's children and the state of America's cities.
nonapplause You've set new priorities.
nonapplause This shouldn't surprise us given his weak record on national security.
nonapplause One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now ranked 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around the world.
nonapplause Fifteen big city school districts  including New York City  said  we support the President's desire to have national standards and national tests and measure kids by how well they do and tell their parents.
nonapplause In some cases  insurance plans don't cover basis women's health services like maternity care or preventative care for mammograms and Pap smears.
nonapplause Those vested interests just hate it when we talk about reform  and they loved it when they thought I was laid up and out of action.
nonapplause Then I want you to ask yourself and answer  “How much of your budget do you think should go to foreign aid?” Poll after poll says most Americans said between 3 and 5%.
nonapplause And we've had a big economic crisis that has required us to take some extraordinary steps.
nonapplause And so I just want to thank all of you who are here for your participation.
nonapplause Marriage that is haunted by the possibility of the child.
nonapplause You go right to India today—in their religion  which is called Buddhism  they give all their Buddhas the image of a Black man  with his lips and his nose  and even show his hair all curled up on his head; they didn't curl it up  he was born that way.
nonapplause Now  a few days ago  I stood at the mouth of the Tagus River in Lisbon.
nonapplause On the one hand  the welfare system that he envisioned created dependency upon government and  on the other hand  the welfare system that he envisioned created a government that crowded out people's aspirations to help a neighbor.
nonapplause Scott understands this very well.
nonapplause Well  good afternoon.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause Remember what Bismarck said
nonapplause Before Marc left for Afghanistan  he arranged for part of his life insurance to pay for one of his former students to attend college.
nonapplause Together we are building what President Bush has called a hemisphere that delivers hope and opportunity for every citizen.
nonapplause And I want to thank all of you who are gathered here for this important announcement.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause He understood the challenges and the pressures and the temptations facing journalism in this new era.
nonapplause So I want you to think about that.
nonapplause We used to be the party of big ideas.
nonapplause So there was a time when I was living this life.
nonapplause I know this is a tough vote.
nonapplause Yes  there have been other indicators saying the economy isn't well yet.
nonapplause These are all tremendous achievements  and the President and I thank you for your support.
nonapplause I want to thank the fact that you understand that you can make a big difference in somebody's life  that you can help a boy and girl who needs help.
nonapplause What you are doing here  the tremendous growth that you've recently enjoyed  all underscores a truth too often ignored in Washington: The most powerful force for progress in this world doesn't come from government elites  public programs  or even precious resources like oil or gold.
nonapplause It is very much a women's issue.
nonapplause It's unheard of for somebody in his or first term of service to have this kind of constructive impact.
nonapplause And he took it upon himself to tell me the story of his first sermon.
nonapplause And the life that he's made since then  which would not have been possible if he hadn't been elected President in the first place  looks awfully good in the light of history.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy
nonapplause If we help Special Olympics establish global networks for families  create new health programs for athletes  and open new opportunity for 2 million athletes around the world  every one of us will be better off.
nonapplause The American Dream for everybody willing to work for it; America leading the world for peace and freedom and security and prosperity; America coming together as one America.
nonapplause No one is going to go follow you around making sure that you're getting to class on time  making sure you're doing your work.
nonapplause But we're here today to talk business.
nonapplause We've got to do this together  and you've got to be part of the debate.
nonapplause We've got your parents helping  because we're asking them to do their part in making sure they know what kind of good food to serve you.
nonapplause We will disagree on the details  but in the end  we will come to the people's business with a resolution.
nonapplause The progress we've made so far is not nearly enough to undo the enormous damage that this recession caused.
nonapplause Now  I know there are a thousand good uses for this surplus.
nonapplause From art being Norman Rockwell to Robert Maplethorpe.
nonapplause I want to ask you to help me get that money.
nonapplause There are many kinds of waste  and I think it is the function of government to use our resources to the fullest  to use our natural and material and human resources to the fullest  to educate our children  to build a stronger economy  to provide medical care for our aged under social security  to use to the fullest those areas of the United States where unemployment has been chronic for a great many years  to use our brains and our energy to build a stronger and better society here in the United States.
nonapplause As well as getting the science right  we must also get the economics right and that means putting a proper value on the global environment.
nonapplause How would you like to sleep in a room that had nobody in it?
nonapplause The new frontier is not the things that I am promising to do for you if I am elected President.
nonapplause If his campaign were a Broadway show  it would be "Promises  Promises."
nonapplause Well  folks  it's our job.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech in Edinburgh
nonapplause That's a message the liberals need to hear.
nonapplause Yes  this is a chance.
nonapplause Alexis de Tocqueville carried this uniquely American optimism  this faith in education  this commitment to change when he wrote in his wondrous Democracy in America: "The Americans have all a lively faith in the perfectibility of man  they judge that the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily be advantageous  and the consequences of ignorance fatal; they all consider society as a body in a state of improvement  humanity as a changing scene  in which nothing is or ought to be permanent; and they admit that what appears to them today to be good  may be superseded by something better tomorrow."
nonapplause You heard from Terry's introduction that the work that we did together made a big difference—and nothing I did in the White House would have been possible— if it hadn't been for you and the other men and women of the labor movement throughout our country.
nonapplause They talk about jobs  yet they never explain how they would put a single American back to work.
nonapplause The tax reductions on cap gains and dividends are doing exactly what we expected.
nonapplause That's what it was all about.
nonapplause It's really important that we do so.
nonapplause Today -- listen to this -- in Washington  the General Accounting Office is releasing a report that shows that Medigap drug coverage starts out expensive and then goes through the roof as seniors get older.
nonapplause Jim Broyhill has supported our efforts to sort of dust off and speak highly of the values that made America not only a great country but a good country.
nonapplause to have him lynched as they did Praeger  an absolutely innocent man.
nonapplause You deserve it.
nonapplause It's a right.
nonapplause Michelle and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister Singh and Mrs. Kaur to the White House for the very first official state visit of my presidency.
nonapplause Never has it been more true that we will all hang separately if we do not hang together.
nonapplause And we need somebody in the White House who understands the future; the Internet  the human genome developments.
nonapplause With all of the progress we've made  both here at home and abroad  the thing that I am most proud of  I think  is the tangible evidence that our country is coming back together around our core values.
nonapplause Still higher taxes.
nonapplause And we firmly believe that  through accountability  not only can we diagnose and solve problems  but accountability serves as a catalyst for reforms.
nonapplause It was minus 0.3 percent.
nonapplause I've talked quite a lot about teaching this afternoon  and there's one story that just about says it all when it comes to the importance of teachers.
nonapplause A $20 000-a-year wage earner would pay hundreds of dollars in higher taxes as a direct cost  but the weaker economy -- reduced savings investment and lower productivity and growth -- would reduce his family's real earnings by much more than the direct cost of higher taxes.
nonapplause And we were happy because we also had a 20-year low in poverty  a 30-year low in unemployment  the lowest African American and Hispanic unemployment rates ever recorded  the lowest female unemployment rate in 40 years.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President at Dnc Fundraiser
nonapplause The problem is that this debate has normally stopped at the rhetorical level.
nonapplause Our idea of fairness is not tax increases  it's tax reductions and indexing.
nonapplause The Bush doctrine makes clear that those states that support terrorists  or provide sanctuary for terrorists  are just as guilty as the terrorists themselves of the acts they commit.
nonapplause But the thing that is driving violence in America is deeper than that -- deeper than all these things.
nonapplause I hear some people say we've grown complacent  that it's time for a change.
nonapplause So I was just talking to a group over at the Westin  and I used the analogy  imagine that our economy is a car.
nonapplause I don't hold Mr. Khrushchev's view that the United States is a sick and faltering horse  but I do realize that though we may quarantine him in Manhattan next week  and though we may do the same to Mr. Castro  we have not quarantined Castro in Latin America or Mr. Khrushchev in Africa.
nonapplause There is profound truth in the proverb "A happy heart maketh good medicine  but a broken spirit dryeth the bones."
nonapplause It's time to end these abuses with strong medical liability reform.
nonapplause And I want to say a word about your United States senators  as well -- George Allen  who is with us today  and John Warner.
nonapplause I've seen them under pressure.
nonapplause You will be confronted with financial strains as your loans become due and salaries fall short of both expectations and expenses.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the Vice President to Technology Industry Leaders
nonapplause Paul works during the day at Ukrops Supermarket in downtown Richmond  Virginia.
nonapplause We cannot imagine exactly what the 21st century will look like  but we know that its science and technology and its unprecedented fusions of cultures and economies will be shaped in large measure by the Internet.
nonapplause Ideas matter.
nonapplause And therefore  we want to partner with you in terms of  one  ending this economic crisis  increasing liquidity and getting smart regulation.
nonapplause America's connections to this place go back a long  long time.
nonapplause I was meeting with the Ambassadors to the UN of the tsunami-effected countries today and I was laughing with the Indian Ambassador because they recently had an election in India.
nonapplause Of course  as many of you have reminded us  budget cuts aren't the only step we've proposed this year to help bring down the deficit  which brings me to everybody's favorite topic -- taxes.
nonapplause I wish you could see some of the charts that we have of what has been happening in recent years: to see this peak and then drop into recession  and then this artificial stimulant of the money supply and so forth  the quick fixes that they employed  and things would go back up  only 2 years later to go back down into a recession.
nonapplause And underlying all Ann's energy and skill  all her immense administrative ability  will be an abiding faith in the dignity of work.
nonapplause Mr. President  many of your predecessors have sat where you sit now or downstairs in the Cabinet Room where we met earlier today as our common experience unfurled—experience of two World Wars and many other conflicts in which both our nations lost so many of their finest young men: the great trials of strength which characterised the Cold War  the Berlin Airlift  Korea  the Berlin Crisis of 1962  Cuba and many other moments when the West was called upon to show great resolve and was never found wanting.
nonapplause Duh!
nonapplause It's our right from birth  because we're all children of God.

nonapplause Intelligence is an uncertain business  even in the best of circumstances.
nonapplause Mr. Secretary General  Mr. Security Council President; to the Presidents of Finland and Namibia  the co-Presidents of this remarkable Millennial Summit.

nonapplause It's a sign that much is right with the world as democratically-elected representatives work to build a new Iraqi government while the tyrant who filled mass graves and terrorized Iraq for decades and started two wars went from a palace to a bunker to a spider hole to jail.
nonapplause I want to tell you a story that's even more compelling.
nonapplause It works.
nonapplause The 101st carried out air assault missions against the enemies of freedom  provided security for national elections  trained some 32 000 police  helped provide border protection  and turned over more territory to 35 Iraqi Army battalions  so they can take the lead in defending their own country.
nonapplause It you pay taxes  you ought to get relief.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech to the Institute of Socio-Economic Studies ("Let Our Children Grow Tall")
nonapplause And on defence  the people can depend on we Conservatives.
nonapplause As the Secretary said  you've put in your share of years at the IRS in Austin  Texas  and working in the same building where her husband was killed.
nonapplause Kerry decided he needed to reposition himself  so he took the liberty of turning his back on the troops and voting -- because of the pressures from Howard Dean -- against providing them with the resources they needed  which leads to the question  if he couldn't take the heat in the primaries from Howard Dean  why would we expect that he's got the capacity to stand up to the pressures of Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda organization.
nonapplause But I have always felt that I would like someday to entertain an atheist at dinner and serve the most gourmet  perfect dinner that has ever been served and then  at the end of the meal  ask that atheist if he believes there's a cook.
nonapplause And if you will join us in what is sure to be a difficult fight in the months and years ahead  I am confident that all of America is going to be pulling in one direction to make sure that we are the energy leader that we need to be.
nonapplause Lower taxes  sensible regulation and more freedom  that's the way to lift wages and to build prosperity all across the country.
nonapplause It is the cross of truth and integrity.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech by President at DC Central Kitchen
nonapplause It is possible for the two to exist  if we're wise about public policy.

nonapplause This team loves being an underdog  and in the end  that made all the difference.
nonapplause Thank you all.
nonapplause And Sandy and Gerry are doing the best thing American employers can do.
nonapplause But even after adjusting for these factors  there remains a sizable pay gap.
nonapplause And most all of them relate somehow or other to the need to balance work and family -- a challenge that faces Americans in all income groups.
nonapplause People say they're concerned about crime and violence -- they ought to be.
nonapplause I know this is hard and I know a lot of you are a long way from home.
nonapplause These are little Cessna airplanes.
nonapplause I mean  these kids can have pen-pals in Mongolia and Botswana and Singapore.
nonapplause And so we have a continuing responsibility to lead in this fight.
nonapplause Well over two centuries have passed since George Washington first took command of the Continental Army.
nonapplause Permit me to burden you with a bit more history: In August of 1998  the U.S. Congress passed a resolution urging President Clinton take "appropriate action" to compel Saddam to come into compliance with his obligations to the Security Council.
nonapplause But you probably wouldn't understand the concept of troubled industries  working as you do in the radio and television.
nonapplause And you  Sir  have tackled both!
nonapplause One: On Quemoy and Matsu.
nonapplause Now  I understand the Razorbacks have a big game this evening.
nonapplause Some of them will come from incentives we give from people coming out of the service as we build down our armed services and give people incentives to move into police or teaching.
nonapplause Members of Congress  passage of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings gives us an historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades: forcing the Federal Government to live within its means.

nonapplause I know that I can always count on the ideals and the convictions of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.
nonapplause We need an open system.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause America is not what it can be.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy  Crestwood Shopping Center
nonapplause This should discourage companies from artificially inflating profits just to cause a temporary spike in stock prices.
nonapplause And money is heart.
nonapplause Thank you for your warm welcome and for giving me this opportunity to address the Federal Assembly.
nonapplause And that's good  because I need them  too  and we all do.
nonapplause The policies I outlined today are part of our effort to reinvent government -- to make it your partner and not your overseer -- to lead by example and not by bureaucratic fiat.
nonapplause Now  going on offense means a couple of things  first of all  using the full might and power of the United States to go after the terrorists  wherever they plot and plan and train and organize  and we've been doing that.
nonapplause Sometimes we were successful and sometimes not  but 100 years ago  the major military issue was the continuation of our war with Spain and the Philippines  and the extension of our military power in our own hemisphere.
nonapplause In September  we saw solid increases in the sales of new homes  in the growth of housing starts and  even more important  in new housing permits.
nonapplause It means more caregivers needing support.
nonapplause But if you don't think it will  we'll do it on your numbers.
nonapplause It really bothers me that we've got the greatest economy in the history of America  the lowest poverty rate in 20 years  the lowest African American poverty rate ever measured -- we've only been measuring it about just under 30 years -- but if you go to any inner city  if you go to the Mississippi Delta  if you go to Appalachia  if you go to the Indian reservation -- unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota is 73 percent -- you will see that there are people who have not participated in our prosperity.
nonapplause This war also is a conflict of visions.
nonapplause It would be a travesty if we at this moment  when we have things going in the right direction  when all of the problems we have require us to keep going and do more in that direction  if we took a terrible veer off into the dark waters of some extremist theory that drug this country into more division  in more problems  in more heartache  and that compromise the future of these young people.
nonapplause So if each of you will look under your seat  you find that --   -- you get a car company!
nonapplause Today on every major crisis that faces the United States  from the crisis at Formosa to Berlin  in the plight of our cities  of people out of work  we hear no blare of bugles  din  din; we see only plodding feet  tramp  tramp  and the Grand Old Party breaking camp.
nonapplause But Mr. Rodriguez lives  a personification of courage and inspiration to us all  and the holder of the highest award that we can give  the Congressional Medal of Honor.
nonapplause and Harry Truman is dead and gone; that the Democratic Party has been taken over by the left; that the departure from the mainstream that we began to see at their 1968 convention now defines the party at the national level  especially the liberal leadership in Congress.
nonapplause And they  clearly  did not understand the determination of our President.
nonapplause Now  our friends in the other party  they made a big thing of that  but now they don't think it's so important.
nonapplause All of us together are part of a great revolution  and it's only just begun.
nonapplause Folks  65 years ago this week  less than 200 kilometers south of here  Nazi leaders signed an unconditional surrender that brought an end to the Second World War in Europe.
nonapplause What's at stake here is our success in the global war on terror.
nonapplause When the tsunami hit Southeast Asia  the miracle of technology contributed to the most unprecedented outpouring in the United States and around the world from ordinary citizens to help their fellow human beings across the globe.

nonapplause If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush doctrine  I would urge that person to consider the fate of the Taliban in Afghanistan and of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.
nonapplause But I don't think -- I can't recall a time when I ever felt that the decisions we're going are as momentous as they are this time around  that there are periods in our history when things go along swimmingly.
nonapplause I think I'm going to quit right now.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause The bill is going to invest in service learning  a concept that now is a part of this culture  thanks to you.
nonapplause Now  in 1992  the year before I took office  only 20 percent of the new jobs created in the United States paid above average wages.
nonapplause And I think it is quite interesting that  with all this modern stuff going on  the biggest problem we've got is the oldest problem of human society -- with all this racial and religious and ethnic hatred  and hatred of gays.
nonapplause Hurricane Fran is about to deliver what could be a powerful punch in the states of Georgia  South Carolina and North Carolina  and I want all of you to be thinking about them today.

nonapplause Today if you work all your life and happen to die before 62  and your wife or husband works alongside you  you get survivor benefits when you turn 62  or the benefits from Social Security  which is ever higher  but not both.
nonapplause We do this because it's right.
nonapplause Even if there had been no Communist threat  we would have been concerned about the plight of hundreds of thousands of children in Italy who didn't have enough to eat  of people who were homeless  of people who just wanted a chance to get on their feet.
nonapplause We pay down a lot of debt.
nonapplause And I think that's why you're here today.
nonapplause Mr. Truman could also make very plain the differences between himself and his opponent.
nonapplause And it has been my honor to serve her and her great cause - freedom.
nonapplause So I want you to feel good about it  and I don't want you to be discouraged because we didn't win every fight we were in.
nonapplause And so I get to spend a lot of time in the Senate  if you will.
nonapplause But that's neither here nor there.
nonapplause I don't think since the time of Athens  2 000 years ago  has any people had placed upon them the same burden of responsibilities that we have placed here.
nonapplause And I said  yes.
nonapplause We don't have freedom.
nonapplause There's tangible  visible progress on the ground there in Iraq.
nonapplause Social Security is deeply woven into our nation's social fabric.
nonapplause That is what we have to be concerned about  to make sure that the people of the world feel that this system of ours has endless vitality  that we are moving ahead  that we are solving our problems  that they can look to us for leadership in the future  that the balance of power is shifting to us  not to the Communists.
nonapplause The President pointed out that afternoon that the economy had already begun a significant slowdown.
nonapplause I feel like I'm coming home to old friends and neighbors.

nonapplause In 1969  Mr. Rumsfeld  then head of the Office of Economic Opportunity in the White House  spotted a talented  brilliant  young congressional staffer and hired him as his special assistant.
nonapplause And believe me  they were on their glide path from Honolulu in.
nonapplause The main reason I ran for President is  it seemed to me that we were seeing a national government in bipartisan gridlock  where we'd had 12 years in which we exploded the deficit  reduced our investment in people  and undermined our ability to compete and win in the world.
nonapplause But here in Ohio  during the primaries  Senator Gary Hart got his message through by reminding the Ohio voters of the true record.
nonapplause But essentially  let me tell you  for those of you who are interested in this  what we're trying to do.
nonapplause I am delighted to be here today and whether you came as Democrats  Republicans  independents  convinced  unconvinced  I do appreciate the chance to speak with you.
nonapplause Over the last generation  we have worked hard to restore our natural treasures and to find a way conduct our economy that is more in harmony with the environment.
nonapplause Because they're doing the right thing anyway  and they're at an unconscionable disadvantage by treating their people right unless everybody else follows the same rules.
nonapplause The award goes to organizations rather than any single individual.
nonapplause It is hard to see if you are listening to some of my colleagues  because I think the only thing any of them seem to think is important in this country is money  and what's related to it.
nonapplause Is it extremist to oppose the Callaghan government's run-down of the armed forces  is it extremist to be concerned about the strength of our defences?

nonapplause Yet within his days of his confirmation by a unanimous vote in the Senate -- I repeat  a unanimous vote of confidence in General Petraeus -- a large group of senators tried to pass a resolution opposing the reinforcements he said were necessary.
nonapplause And under the heaviest possible enemy fire  he carried them to safety.
nonapplause So the reason I thought the President's Summit of Service that we did -- the former Presidents and General Powell did in Philadelphia was so important is it gives us a chance to mobilize millions of people around specific objectives that I'm also trying to see the government do its part.
nonapplause So there was no election last year thanks to Mr Steel  and that leaves Mr Callaghan with a much freer hand about when to call it.
nonapplause And I think we should walk out of this room  thanking our lucky stars that we could be here today  thanking God we got the chance to serve and test our ideas  and being absolutely determined that we are going to be of good cheer  of strong confidence  and we're going to make absolutely sure the American people know why we stand for what we stand for  and exactly what we intend to do in the 21st century.
nonapplause Right now  we can only beat AIDS by preventing it  by changing behavior and changing attitudes and breaking the silence about how the disease is transmitted and how it can be stopped.

nonapplause Secondly  we have fought for medical care for the aged tied to social security.
nonapplause Economic growth is at a 20-year high and home ownership is at the highest ever.
nonapplause The fact is  years of runaway government spending in the sixties and seventies produced an inflationary binge that threw millions of people into poverty.
nonapplause Let this not be the generation that betrays that hope in pursuit of a delusory understanding of freedom that denies the principle of God's authority on which that hope is grounded.
nonapplause On another subject  I'm proud to say that in these last 4 years  not 1 square inch of territory anyplace in the world has been lost to Communist aggression.
nonapplause But I want you to leave here with a clear understanding that what we have to do is to go out to the American people and say  look  most elections in times like this are sort of stand-pat elections  where the electorate is rather complacent  the turnout is rather low.
nonapplause We have not simply been a caring Government  we have helped to make this a more caring society.
nonapplause On these and many  many other issues  I hope and believe we can cooperate with the new Congress.
nonapplause I believe that the American people who are poised to take advantage of it will have more opportunities to live out their dreams than any generation of Americans every has.
nonapplause I was intrigued by -- some material here  I got some notes here that I wanted to bring with me today  some things John Kerry has been working on the last few days.
nonapplause That's what a lot of my former colleagues up on Capitol Hill are looking at now -- almost independent of how many jobs such investments will create.
nonapplause We are making a difference.
nonapplause Let's move to ensure that they can later live lives where they can keep up with their own kids  maybe keep up with their own grandkids  and if they're blessed  maybe their great-grandkids.
nonapplause Let us in this Joshua generation learn how that Moses generation overcame.
nonapplause But I want to thank you  too  for everything you're doing to support our party and those values so crucial to a strong and a successful country.

nonapplause This plan will provide sensible tax relief for the struggling middle class  and unemployment insurance and continued health care coverage for those who've lost their jobs.
nonapplause And if we don't have an answer  we call them in 24 hours and tell them why we don't have the answer and when they'll get the answer -- because  again  this was all about establishing credibility at the front end of this that this was going to be done well and differently  with accountability and transparency.
nonapplause Her husband's business is in Albuquerque; two of their children are in college.
nonapplause Abroad  we seek to lift whole nations by spreading freedom.

nonapplause You know  in a long career in politics  there's one overwhelming reason why I never ran for mayor  Richie  it's too hard.
nonapplause And I have watched with interest as the state has emerged from its economic recession  starting in 1993 and coming forward -- Californians in the most popular state in the country and a state where it's fairly easy to get an initiative on the ballot  have been asked to come to grips with issues that are being debated.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause And if we do  we can continue to lower tax rates  which will further encourage the working men and women of this country and further encourage economic expansion.
nonapplause Our belief that the rights that Americans have for freedom belong not just to ourselves  but to the whole world.
nonapplause On behalf of my group  I ally myself with what the President of the Commission said about Parliament because I believe that what is needed here is mediation and initiative  not begging.

nonapplause And if you pay the debt off  we'll sure have a stronger economy  by far  than we otherwise would have.

nonapplause Quincy  let me just say this.
nonapplause The same spirit can be seen in the respect we show to each life laid down for this nation.

nonapplause It's just our governments that are based on different principles.
nonapplause The student loan program  the direct loan program  started when I became President because I wanted to find a way to cut the cost of college loans  to cut the unbelievable bureaucratic paperwork headache  and to give students more options about how to repay loans  because I began to see students in our state who were dropping out of college because they were terrified that they would never be able to repay their loans  especially students who were going to do things that were important to our society but didn't pay a lot  students who wanted to be teachers  students who wanted to be nurses  students who wanted to be police officers.
nonapplause We created new institutions; created the Department of Defense  the Central Intelligence Agency  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  a whole series of steps we took in the late '40s to put in place a national security strategy that then put us in good stead for the next 40 years under Republican and Democratic administration alike  until finally we prevailed in the Cold War in 1990 and '91  when the old Soviet Union went out of business.
nonapplause That in turn works hand in glove with the President's efforts to open new markets around the world  to have this huge increase in exports from this nation to the rest of the world  with high-paying jobs increasing rapidly as we go out to sell goods and services to the 96 percent of the world's consumers that are outside the United States of America.

nonapplause Costa Rica's foundation of democracy and law  as President Monge said in Washington  is your guarantee of peace.
nonapplause The first thing I would like to say is that ideas matter in politics  and they have consequences.
nonapplause First of all  insofar as we have had any success over these last seven and a half years  the real credit belongs to the people of this country for supporting us and for what they do outside the government sphere all day  every day  and to the fact that I think we had good ideas.

nonapplause And if we're to find our way back to clear moral health and foundations  I think we're going to have to confront  first and foremost  those issues that epitomize the corrupt and licentious concept of freedom that you and I both know is destroying this country.
nonapplause You know the trouble is too often people think that in dealing with men like Khrushchev they react like the leaders of the free world.
nonapplause And just one thought: We accomplished this and  at the same time  kept inflation lower than it's been for over 20 years.
nonapplause To grow and deepen their legitimacy  to foster a middle class and a civic culture  they need the ability to tap into a growing global economy.
nonapplause So I don't believe that this administration and our country has recognized its responsibilities that the world is changing as fast as it is.
nonapplause Up at 4:30 a.m.  5:00 in the morning at the latest  they began their day  as they worked  in darkness.
nonapplause Over the last several generations  we've had three major tax cuts in this country -- in the 1960s under President Kennedy  in the 1980s under President Reagan  and now under President Bush.
nonapplause And I want to tell you that  just like your family  friends  and communities  I'm mighty proud of you.
nonapplause We have the finest school system in the world today.
nonapplause We have to make sure they take advantage of the newest technologies.
nonapplause When?
nonapplause This is not simply a debt that we are repaying to the remarkable men and women who have served -- it is an investment in our own country.
nonapplause We will have to change our ideas and work for change.
nonapplause He said  "Just think  somewhere today someone was buried under a flower arrangement inscribed  'Good luck in your new location.'"
nonapplause I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself.
nonapplause That can't be good for business.
nonapplause Let us continue to work on this deficit.
nonapplause Now  what's that got to do with Sheila Jackson Lee?
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy  Salem  Ohio  Stadium
nonapplause A lot of people came together to make this day possible -- business and government  grassroots organizations  ordinary citizens who are committed to this city's future.
nonapplause But I also wanted to talk about how your community and all communities across our nation can protect our precious water resources -- from the tap water to the rivers to the lakes to the ocean.
nonapplause It's already cut the rate of growth in Federal spending nearly in half  cut taxes for individuals and business by over $300 billion.
nonapplause This is why America means something in the world today.
nonapplause I want to express my thanks to all of you.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to the Citizens of Boston

nonapplause Their nominee says his favorite judges are Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia  by far the most conservative judges on the Court.
nonapplause Our country's days of apologizing are over.
nonapplause Have we got any Democrats here at all?
nonapplause Dick  good luck to you.
nonapplause That's how we'll confront the challenges of our time.
nonapplause These barriers are tougher to remove.
nonapplause There are really only two possibilities.
nonapplause They cling to a payscale based on seniority and the number of college credits earned.
nonapplause That is the situation today.
nonapplause And most of all  of course  it led to AmeriCorps  which now has permitted over 150 000 young Americans to serve in their communities.
nonapplause As we face this prospect  old doctrines of security do not apply.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause You look at what happens to these countries that try to hide their money -- people still get it out.
nonapplause The budget  in fact  would be balanced today if it weren't for the interest we have to pay on the debt run up between 1981 and 1992.
nonapplause Last March  I outlined this administration's agricultural trade doctrine Jack Block mentioned to you.
nonapplause The policies that led to this economic disaster were pretty straightforward: You cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires who don't need the tax cuts  didn't even ask for them.
nonapplause And that's why there's such a deep bond between this organization and the city.
nonapplause Second  I will continue on the path of repentance  seeking pastoral support and that of other caring people so that they can hold me accountable for my own commitment.
nonapplause And the great domestic crisis we had was a civil rights crisis.
nonapplause This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens -- leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause No sharper example can be found than the Democratic Party chairman himself  Howard Dean  who said the capture of Saddam Hussein did not make America any safer.
nonapplause I have seen that.
nonapplause And in case anyone doubted it  can I assure you there will be no ducking the bouncers  no stonewalling  no playing for time.
nonapplause We hope the Senate will follow the President's lead and pass a comprehensive energy plan in the coming weeks.
nonapplause The deficit was at $1.3 trillion.
nonapplause Now  here's the thing about elections.
nonapplause Indeed  for nearly 200 years of our history  it was considered a natural expression of our religious freedom.
nonapplause And so we've got a choice between a forward-looking agenda that is rebuilding the structure of this economy so it's working for all Americans  or just going back to the same stuff that got us into this mess.
nonapplause And do any of you believe we can gain a political consensus for doing that without growing clean energy industries here in America?
nonapplause From Fortune 500 companies to Opryland  to companies like the recycling business that Noah described  it represents your whole business community.
nonapplause We're not there yet.
nonapplause This Paperwork Reduction Act helps us to conquer a mountain of paperwork that is crushing our people and wasting a lot of time and resources  and which actually accumulated not because anybody wanted to harm the private sector  but because we tend to think of good ideas in serial form without thinking of how the overall impact of them impacts a system that is very dynamic and very sensitive to emerging technologies  but which government does not always respond to in the same way.
nonapplause And there is no better symbol of that strength than the USS Enterprise.
nonapplause One of the battery commanders from the 201st is Captain Jeff Setser.
nonapplause And what we were able to do is what I believe a true fiscal conservative is  which is somebody who pays their bills and meets their obligations  obligations to core services.
nonapplause And remember  the government would only confiscate that $33 billion one time.
nonapplause But I also know that we can love our way out of the problems we find in our neighborhoods  in our communities.
nonapplause That's the good news.
nonapplause So it's been an exciting time.
nonapplause In Iraq  a regime that supported terror  that brutalized its own people  and threatened its neighbors with the peace -- and the peace of the world  no longer exists.
nonapplause And they accomplished so much in that period now known as the Second Hundred Days.
nonapplause For 50 years  trade decisions were largely the province of trade ministers  heads of government  and business interests.
nonapplause The 25th Infantry secured the polling sites in the Oruzgan province after receiving insurgent fire.
nonapplause And you do have to wonder why.
nonapplause This was mentioned last year by Secretary Albright.
nonapplause They thwarted attempts to blow up the Holland Tunnel  the Lincoln Tunnel  the Los Angeles airport  an attempt on the Pope's life  an attempt to destroy the largest hotel in Amman  Jordan  and a Christian site in the Holy Land over the Millennium  attempts to plant bombs in cities in the Northeast and Northwest over the Millennium weekend.
nonapplause In this respect I am pleased to hear that you support the plans of Foreign Ministers Colombo and Genscher to extend European Political Cooperation and that you are clearly in favour of Spanish and Portuguese entry; in general I can only underscore what you said on the need for continued development of the European Community.
nonapplause One of the news wire services had already sent the following story all across the United States: “Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday quote ‘My wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost  family restaurant --   -- named Shoney's.
nonapplause Let no one say this man was not deadly serious about his job.
nonapplause It doesn't always happen automatically  because the truth is  you can't hang out with famous folks like these every day  right?
nonapplause Thousands have shut their doors altogether.
nonapplause We cleaned up more toxic waste sites in the last three years than were cleaned up in the previous 12 years.
nonapplause You saw a movie about the accomplishments of the administration  and then Secretary Bentsen was kind enough to get up and talk about it  and others did.
nonapplause This country was founded during some harsh winters.
nonapplause And I am proud of our aggressive support for the Human Genome Project.
nonapplause Our relationships with Japan have been durable not only because of our security alliance and our political partnership  but because our economic relationship has actually served our interests and yours.
nonapplause I visited 2 weeks ago the SAC headquarters at Omaha.
nonapplause And I hope that -- a lot of my folks at home might take offense at what I said today  but I'm trying to help explain them to you.
nonapplause Oh  I know there's a lot of talk about Mexican laborers coming to the United States.
nonapplause Nations in Asia and Europe have answered this question  in part by creating standards to make sure their teachers and students are performing at the same high levels throughout their nation.
nonapplause And that's why today we're launching the next phase of our work to promote responsible fatherhood -- a new  nationwide Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative.
nonapplause America is already starting to take that message to heart.
nonapplause It'll be fair.
nonapplause All the great leaders of our time  from Winston Churchill to John Kennedy  have understood that to maintain the peace we must maintain our strength.
nonapplause Now it is £3285.
nonapplause This is thinking time  not cheering time.
nonapplause We responded.
nonapplause Behind each of these stories -- behind these statistics is a story of heartache  it's a story of frustration.
nonapplause And most of all  Mr. Egger  I thank you and the people here at D.C. Central Kitchen.
nonapplause How do we do it together in a way that enables us to achieve our objectives?
nonapplause I think it should be about  what are we going to do with this moment of promise?
nonapplause And we've got a real interest in their growing.
nonapplause Omar Khayyam is right: "The moving finger writes  and having writ moves on."
nonapplause And when times are tough -- when times are tough  I know it can be easy to give in to cynicism.
nonapplause Yes!
nonapplause One of the top priorities of our administration has been to encourage the American people as individuals  as organizations in private and in business life to get more directly involved in getting things done  solving problems  and helping each other.
nonapplause Bitter the chastening rod
nonapplause And the response has been strong.
nonapplause We've created an environment in which firms and entrepreneurs are more willing to take risk  innovate  invest  and hire more workers.
nonapplause Come to find out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everyplace else.
nonapplause That's why the language of firmness  the language of strength  that's what's kept the peace for the last 7½ years.
nonapplause Folks  I will say again  I know I could stand up here and give you all those hoop-di-doo lines  but you need to think about this.
nonapplause And so it's an enormous  enormous effort  and we really  all of us  are so indebted to these people who have been recognized today with these two agencies  and to others all across the country who are working on this problem in the public and in the private sectors.
nonapplause It's about making it possible for citizens in free countries to pursue their chosen destinies  to live out their dreams  to give their children a chance to live out their dreams  to manage the tumult of the modern world in a way that seizes all the brilliant opportunities that are out there and deals with the challenges in a forthright and fair way.
nonapplause We had ideas in 1992 that we believed could put the American people first and build our bridge to a new century and a whole new aspect of human affairs.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President Senator Tom Daschle And Congressman Dick Gephardt At Democratic Agenda Event
nonapplause We are a democracy  defended by volunteers who deserve all the tools and all the support we can provide.
nonapplause And when I'm president  we're going to have a country that reflects that.
nonapplause Well  we are  of course  living--as I live in Maryland  I live now under the influence of the Clinton administration.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech to European Parliament
nonapplause After he graduated from the University of Illinois  Peter Roskam's first job was teaching high school history and government in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
nonapplause It's a small delegation.
nonapplause The American people want health care to be there when they need it and they want it to be there at a reasonable price.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy  City Hall  Newark  N.J.
nonapplause And now  2 weeks ago today  I didn't get to finish something I was saying in a debate.
nonapplause Because we need it.
nonapplause And they said  “Well  what are you going to do?” He said  “I'm going to change the way I eat because I don't want to catch that obesity deal.”   Sometimes we don't quite understand how things work.
nonapplause May we have faith in our God and in all the good that we can do with His help.
nonapplause We sequenced the human genome.
nonapplause So this is going to be a big challenge.
nonapplause He must be firm  but he must see to it that the war of words never becomes the extent that it might risk a war of another kind.
nonapplause Pull back regulations  and encourage free and open competition.
nonapplause They walked into an empty room with no desks  and of course they looked around and they said  where are our desks.
nonapplause I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time.
nonapplause Thomas Jefferson of the State of Virginia was so anxious for this country to move that when he came back from Europe after the Constitutional Convention he objected to George Washington because the Constitutional Convention had agreed to the founding of the Senate.
nonapplause And we -- myself and those generations I mentioned -- our sacred trust is  and we pledge to you -- when it comes your turn  we're going to turn over the reins of an America that is free in a world that is at peace.
nonapplause We also want to take some strategic surgical steps in areas that are going to generate the greatest number of jobs while generating the greatest value for our economy.
nonapplause That's right   Nowhere have the riots won any concrete improvement such as have the organized protest demonstrations.
nonapplause So I hear her opponent is calling himself an independent.
nonapplause It's a budget that says we could spend more money on the public's education system around America.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause If I may paraphrase a tanker community motto: "No one can do without tanker gas."
nonapplause Because now so many people change jobs several times during their career  workers need health care insurance that they can take with them.
nonapplause And so we've moved aggressively to strengthen our defenses  create the Department of Homeland Security  the biggest governmental reorganization in 60 years.
nonapplause But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war.
nonapplause And let's not forget that all of you can be proud that your company was an official sponsor of the Olympics.
nonapplause American leadership is necessary for the tide of history to keep running our way  and for our children to have the future they deserve.
nonapplause Amid such political uncertainty and economic difficulty  some now talk of abandoning the path of reform and returning to policies of the past  even policies that have already failed.
nonapplause So keep all that in mind tonight as we watch these debates.
nonapplause Jenny  thank you for your kind prayer.
nonapplause For example  now we need Europeans to help us solve the Iranian nuclear problem.
nonapplause For many kids  that's where they're getting the vast majority of their calendars -- calories.
nonapplause And I can tell you that in the next few years  no one will be able to deny the fact that we will actually have more stable  more widespread  more long-term economic growth if we improve the environment.
nonapplause Preserve America now has three separate programs to help communities preserve their past and promote heritage tourism.
nonapplause We did have a great renewal of the IDEA a year or so ago.
nonapplause And the United States is more secure than it was 4 years ago.
nonapplause There was such life and vitality and all kinds of delicious foods  just like here  and I said to the man next to me  I said  "If anyone felt lonely  this is the place to be."
nonapplause His encounter was similar to Richard Clarke's.
nonapplause The Senate has 37 nominations before it now  and 29 of those folks have never gotten a hearing.
nonapplause I know why I'm a Democrat in the year 1999.
nonapplause Paula Hawkins is a Senator of accomplishment.
nonapplause We've got schoolchildren all across the country out raising a dollar to send to the children of Afghanistan.
nonapplause And with this historic legislation we will  indeed  show that one of the best ways to open minds is through open markets.
nonapplause I believe out of this great evil will come great good.
nonapplause And we will act  not only to create new jobs  but to lay a new foundation for growth.
nonapplause All of the hopes that I have for my daughter's generation  for the grandchildren I hope to have  for all of you who are younger than me and  unlike me  still have most of your lives ahead of you  rest upon our ability to get the world to embrace a simple set of ideas  that we must move from interdependence to integration because our common humanity matters more than our interesting differences and makes the expression of those differences possible; because every child deserves a chance  every adult has a role to play and we all do better when we work together.
nonapplause Thank you  Mr. Vice President.
nonapplause If you just look at the first chart over here on the right  you will see that in 1959 -- I don't see as well as I once did --   -- the poverty rate among seniors was still 35 percent.
nonapplause Now  much needs to be done by all of us in the community of civilized nations.
nonapplause In 1965  that usually meant house calls  or operations  or long hospital stays.
nonapplause It occurred to me when I was getting ready for this that hockey is a lot like Washington politics.
nonapplause Discussions of wind and solar power  and a big focus on energy efficiency  and a belief that that is the quickest way to get gas reductions since there's lots of money to be made by pursuing energy efficient opportunities.
nonapplause We are on the move now.
nonapplause And I want you to draw another line  connecting those responsible for both of those unbelievable tragedies that embarrassed our nation in the eyes of the world.
nonapplause That would have been the beginning of a new dark ages.
nonapplause But it's not a substitute for other necessary steps to ensure our leadership in a new clean energy economy.
nonapplause We need to imagine what it's going to be like 30 years from now.
nonapplause And I said  "Wait a minute  let me get this straight."
nonapplause And one of the things that I've tried to talk about is how the revolution of 1980 is open to and eager for the help of the rank-and-file members of the Democratic Party.
nonapplause We had to do that.
nonapplause We are the only country in the world with an advanced economy that has not figured out how to cover everybody.
nonapplause I'm honored to be here with your other leaders.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause Thanks to Paula's unwavering support  we've made great progress -- with the liberals kicking  screaming  and fighting us all the way -- in rebuilding our military strength is where we've made that progress.
nonapplause Listen  and I see enough short haircuts that I believe there are some people here that aren't in uniform  also.
nonapplause But your vote will decide whether we keep on doing that -- whether we provide health insurance to another million children  whether we help families who lose their jobs keep their health insurance when they're between jobs  whether we continue to work with states like Florida to help offer affordable health insurance to working people with limited incomes.
nonapplause A century ago  when Mr. Pinchot was first dreaming up his plan to protect our forests  this vista looked very different than what we see today.
nonapplause Just a few weeks ago  our Ambassador  Jeane Kirkpatrick  also toured the area.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at Ceremony Honoring 250th Anniversary Of The Birth Of Thomas Jefferson
nonapplause And it's our privilege to live in a country where we can exercise that responsibility.
nonapplause Must we just accept the destabilization of an entire region from the Panama Canal to Mexico on our southern border?
nonapplause It is!
nonapplause In Afghanistan  Taliban and al Qaeda fighters waged new offensives against Afghan and NATO forces.
nonapplause And the precursor to the Internet  known as ARPANET  stealth technology  the Global Positioning System all owe a debt to the work of DARPA.
nonapplause None of this could have happened without a coalition of realists -- people in both Houses of Congress and  importantly  people from both parties; people from coast to coast in our towns and cities and communities who know that the wealth and well-being of the United States depends upon our leadership abroad.
nonapplause And I intend to support this effort not just with words of encouragement  but with resources.
nonapplause Of course  there have been a few changes in diplomacy since then  and I am told there is a Memorandum surviving in the Smithsonian from President Jefferson to his Secretary of State  in which he wrote as follows: "We have not heard anything from our Ambassador to France for three years.
nonapplause You know  nobody makes us take these jobs.
nonapplause We can see the culture of service and responsibility growing around us.
nonapplause Congressman Markey was here -- there he is -- thank you very much for being here and for your support.
nonapplause The fact of the matter was  we'd been hit repeatedly over the years prior to 9/11  and there rarely was a penalty imposed on the terrorists themselves.
nonapplause And when they see you guys every day  that helps them in a way that -- I think if you heard from Michelle  sometimes she feels like when she was coming up she didn't always have that.
nonapplause And I have folks who say  just like the situation that I outlined to you with the court trying to order the president about when it comes to the deployment of our forces  if a president were to say  "No " one reporter said to me  "Well  that would be a constitutional crisis."
nonapplause For me  that was a lot  not like today.
nonapplause Senior citizens were driven into panic by higher rents  exhorbitant fuel costs  dramatically increasing food prices  and Federal health care costs  which went up a massive 87 percent.
nonapplause We're allocating $60 million a year over the next five years to give grants and loans to underserved rural communities where people must diversify their economy on an available  attainable scale in order to preserve the fabric of life there.
nonapplause And they  most of them  don't know this  but anybody who is over 30 years old has lived long enough to have made at least one whopper of a mistake in your life  not when times are going real poorly  but when times were going so well you thought there was simply no consequence to the failure to concentrate.
nonapplause So I say Tuesday is about whether we'll have a patients' bill of rights  whether we'll have good schools for all our children  whether we will raise the minimum wage  whether we will save Social Security for the 21st century.
nonapplause So this is a problem we cannot afford to accept and we cannot afford to ignore.
nonapplause There were conversations with the President  with our military commanders  and decisions to be made about civilian flights  military air cover over major cities  and disaster response.
nonapplause Decade after decade  young Americans who loved their country; and loved its ideals; who knew that it stood for something larger in the world; came here to this spot to wade into the rushing currents of history because they believed that they could change its course.
nonapplause The only thing unsettling about being here is that every time I hear someone talk about fiddling  I think another congressional committee is tampering with the budget.
nonapplause The other thing that might work is some version of the British devolution  what they're doing in Scotland and Wales.
nonapplause And we had a number of difficult decisions that we had to make and make quickly.
nonapplause We also have tried to change our notion of the primary role of government.
nonapplause He was born into politics -- and very fortunately for the country  he made politics his calling.
nonapplause But the problem is that we have to have more personal savings as well.
nonapplause Well  don't you believe it.
nonapplause And we have been very blessed by our times there.
nonapplause And overcoming enormous challenges is not going to be easy.
nonapplause And I spoke to a Japanese family who told me how grateful they were that they had a chance to look around for what they thought was the very best vehicle for their family.
nonapplause That's the important thing.
nonapplause Too many Americans suffered under segregation and discrimination.
nonapplause Putting family and community back at the center of our concern.
nonapplause I said in New Orleans that the convention our liberal opponents held in Atlanta was the biggest masquerade since last year's Mardi Gras.
nonapplause So  why isn't my opponent speaking out now about those winds of democracy?
nonapplause It was  “I'll give you everything they did with a smaller government and a bigger tax cut.” Wouldn't you like that?
nonapplause The reason Woodrow Wilson could put forward his 14 points was because he stood for the New Freedom here in the United States.
nonapplause But let me try to put this in perspective.
nonapplause That's why I'll be meeting with the food manufacturers in the Grocery Manufacturers Association  calling on them to offer healthier options.
nonapplause Just so that I can even make it feel a little closer  in that school where I was playing football  we were called the Red Devils.
nonapplause We are Americans  and that is what we do.
nonapplause Two-and-a-half years ago  there was a lot of talk about education reform.
nonapplause other nations  have formed the Proliferation Security Initiative  to identify and interdict the most dangerous weapons and missile technologies in transit.
nonapplause It means higher interest rates  more inflation and a slower economy.
nonapplause Well  now  let me explain that a little bit.
nonapplause I hope I'm not contributing to a number of schoolboard bankruptcies with that story.
nonapplause We hope that there are schools all across this country that will join the challenge.
nonapplause Senator Kerry looks at all this economic growth and the efforts of workers across America  and somehow can only find cause for pessimism.
nonapplause We must forgive each other  redeem each other  regroup and move one.
nonapplause War makes possible all such crimes and outrages.
nonapplause And I'm looking forward to working with Senator Mark Kennedy to secure this country  to do our duty in Washington  D.C. and do everything we can to protect the people.
nonapplause Oh  it'll be really bad on middle-class people who want to buy homes and cars.
nonapplause And when they looked at the defense issues  they looked again and were trying to decide about various prerogatives that the federal government can have in terms of the appropriation of land  in terms of other things that they had to do for the sake of our national security  and right there the Preamble says that the objective of the whole government is to "provide for the common defense " and so forth and so on.
nonapplause We could provide health care coverage to all the working families in this country who don't have it.
nonapplause He was confused about the rightness of freeing our students on the island of Grenada.
nonapplause I appreciate Fred Ryan  the chairman of the Board of Trustees.
nonapplause I often say to the Chaplain of the Senate  Dr. Harris  that his invocation is usually the best speech made in the day in the Senate.
nonapplause They preach with threats  instruct with bullets and bombs  and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent.
nonapplause Other people think  folks  this is a pretty great country.
nonapplause Thank you  Mr. Vice President.
nonapplause This is very  very important.
nonapplause What I like to do is go and have an opportunity to speak to a large group.
nonapplause I would not see that as part of my mandate in terms of amending the Constitution"--and so forth.
nonapplause There are many issues for us to address  and regardless  regardless as to our homeland  America is home  no matter where we came from  America is home for all of us.
nonapplause The first amendment was not written to protect people and their laws from religious values; it was written to protect those values from government tyranny.
nonapplause I could say to you  too  that my two colleagues in the Senate  Ken Keating and Jack Javits  have done as much as any two men in the whole Congress of the United States in this field.
nonapplause Change is hard.
nonapplause It is the cause of the American Dream  the promise of America  for America's middle class and the promise of safety and security for all of our people.
nonapplause I believe that we support stronger families when we do things which support grass-roots community action.
nonapplause Just days ago we learned that the figure that represents the country's economic growth  the gross national product  GNP  and some other indicators show our economy gathering momentum for even more growth  higher take-home pay  and more new jobs.
nonapplause The Cuban situation is unique in the sense that there is an act of Congress which has certain specifics about the Cuban situation which changes our relationship with Cuba to some extent.
nonapplause And at first  you might have thought  what does anyone in Washington know or care about my battle?
nonapplause So long as our relationship is defined by our differences  we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace  those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity.
nonapplause Before I became President  I heard speech after speech out of the Republicans in Washington -- that I agreed with -- saying that people at the local level have better sense than we do about how to spend this money.
nonapplause I think we are all watching and speaking -- I'm speaking with Zal Khalilzad frequently about the process of government formation that will begin in earnest once the vote count is certified.
nonapplause And now and then  in a kind of an unfriendly way  some people shove signs in my face -- “Nuclear Freeze.” Well  when we can reduce Soviet and American weapons down to an equal and verifiable limit that there is no disadvantage to us  yes  then we'll have a nuclear freeze.
nonapplause If you look at Northern Ireland today  where they haven't been able to stand up a government in two years because the Catholics and Protestants can't get along.
nonapplause Often  they inspire life-changing faith in a way that government never should.
nonapplause Good morning  everyone.
nonapplause Our children  should Jesus tarry  will judge us by what we do on this issue.
nonapplause During Operation Desert Storm  we faced a massive flow of refugees in need of aid and shelter.
nonapplause And I want to go around and say a couple of things as clearly as I can.
nonapplause Alaska only cost us $7 million.
nonapplause By bringing down our prices  by making them cheaper  well  than virtually anywhere in the world  we're going to create powerful incentives for people to invest  produce  and save in America.
nonapplause Every day there are people in this country who are making choices between being good parents and good workers.
nonapplause For many years prior to 9/11  we treated terror attacks against Americans as isolated incidents  and answered - if at all - on an ad hoc basis  and never in a systematic way.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President on The American Graduation Initiative
nonapplause But I walk in there and I sit at this magnificent desk; Ted Stevens has seen it a lot  he's seen other Presidents use this desk as well.
nonapplause She went over about half of it and was able to do the final editing  and it was my privilege after she passed away to work with the author and just try to make sure all the facts were right.
nonapplause We've created more than 150 000 jobs thus far  and we've helped more than a thousand communities and tribes in every state and territory.
nonapplause We see it in this hospital and the depths of its commitment to this city.
nonapplause This program which I have seen in operation in various States is one that is very close to my heart.
nonapplause So that is very close to the heritage and the same sentiments that you have with your live free or die sentiments here in New Hampshire.
nonapplause That's how we ensure that America doesn't just limp along  maybe recover to where we were before  but instead that we're prospering -- that this nation leads the industries of the future.
nonapplause But everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do.
nonapplause So if we could just take a moment in solidarity with the people not only in Colorado who have suffered this loss  but people throughout our country  on behalf of our children.
nonapplause And I want to thank you  the members of the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS  for the extraordinarily important part that you are playing in this  a great moral responsibility of our time.
nonapplause Your countries have done more than any others to awaken the world to the need for international action on the environment and have helped to create the framework and institutions within which we can get things done.
nonapplause The combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq showed the great power and precision of America's modern military.
nonapplause It's the kind of spirit that all of you stand for today.
nonapplause First  let's reach a bipartisan agreement to save Social Security.
nonapplause We remember their service  and we honor their names  just as we remember the thousands like them last seen during their duty whose fate is still undetermined.
nonapplause If you want to preserve your own freedom  you must stand up for the freedom of others with whom you disagree.
nonapplause Whether we're talking about terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  or environmental degradation.

nonapplause He says he suspects it's worth a little more now.
nonapplause We have reformed the Community Reinvestment Act  which basically says what guidelines there ought to be for reinvesting in areas that have been under-invested in; that brought $270 billion in commitments from financial institutions to help people in distressed areas improve their communities.
nonapplause But it's still going to be hard.
nonapplause But I won't  because Gary Hart  a Democrat  has said that.
nonapplause And I want to be brief  but fairly pointed here.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech in Seattle
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause That commitment began when the United States of America emerged from World War II as the preeminent economic  political  and military power in the world  and one of our great Presidents  Harry Truman  reached out to a tiny  struggling state  emerging from the ashes of the Holocaust  and recognized the state of Israel.
nonapplause This is the only true solution.
nonapplause Do you believe the Liberals would have had the guts to introduce them?
nonapplause What I do sense here today -- and whenever I visit with young Americans -- and that is the same unquenchable spirit that I remember among my own classmates at Eureka College so long ago.
nonapplause We have given in aid or at least have promised it  to Latin America  500 millions of dollars passed by the last session of the Congress  not an appropriation but an authorization.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause I wish it can be that way again.
nonapplause But Sunday  he said that he would repeal that protection.
nonapplause And yet  in the last two decades or more something went haywire.
nonapplause I'd like to say a few things on the questions that were asked -- I'm trying to be a bit more precise in my answers  but let me say -- in order to win this challenge  probably we'll need less national government  less central government  but greater governance over local processes.
nonapplause What I'm saying is  now we can't afford to play that game.
nonapplause I want to thank all of you who worked on this event.
nonapplause And this is a very  very important moment for our country  because for at least 30 years  Americans have wanted to do this -- not just politicians; people in business have wished there was some way to bring free enterprise to the people and the places that have been left behind.
nonapplause First  the public interest is a dangerous myth according to Bush's ideology -- a fiction created by those hated liberals who use the notion of public interest as an excuse to take away from the wealthy and powerful what they do believe is their due.
nonapplause They had come to see me in the Oval Office because  guess what happened?
nonapplause The possibilities of where this research might lead are endless.
nonapplause Thirteen children die in this country every day from gun violence.
nonapplause And I want to speak just briefly today on a question: is that true?
nonapplause And we're going to keep it that way.
nonapplause And I know in the crowd are a lot of local elected officials and candidates  and I want to thank you all for your service to all of your communities and to our country.
nonapplause For first of all  let me make a couple of remarks about this year's election because I think it truly is one of the most remarkable and important elections in my lifetime.
nonapplause And it can be something as simple -- you know what your Family Readiness support groups do -- it's something simple as offering babysitting  or handling carpool duty  or giving a stressed mom a break; bringing over a meal.
nonapplause This  it seems to me  would be the ultimate tribute to the people who did such important work at Nuremberg -- a permanent international court to prosecute such violations.
nonapplause And she said  right  and now he'd be Vice President of the United States.
nonapplause Millions of them vote for us at every Election.
nonapplause Now  some feel that my decision is at odds with my philosophical viewpoint that State problems should involve State solutions and it isn't up to a big and overwhelming government in Washington to tell the States what to do.
nonapplause And she knew tyranny is powerless against the primary of the heart.
nonapplause Today  we have a stronger labor movement and more partnership and if we were trying to hurt the economy  we did a poor job of it.

nonapplause I'm here because I want to talk with you about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year.
nonapplause So all of this has to be observed.
nonapplause I told a little while ago some of your fellow Nebraskans a little story.
nonapplause No  so one question must be answered: Sandinista promises of the past have been broken; can we believe them now?
nonapplause Should we fight for a fair deal for our workers?
nonapplause If we would give people on Medicare the option  purely the option  to buy in to a prescription drug program that could use market power to get discount prices  we could deal with the problems of 75 percent of the seniors in this country that don't have access to those pharmaceuticals now.
nonapplause In the last 20 years  as Government got into areas where it didn't belong  it failed to meet one of its most important and legitimate responsibilities.
nonapplause That's learning.
nonapplause If you are a young person  and most of your life is still ahead of you  you've got a lot more at stake in this debate than the people who right now are drawing Medicare.
nonapplause And judges aren't like residents or congressmen  but they should reflect America.
nonapplause Told he was too young for the military  he joined the National Guard's delayed entry program as a junior in high school.
nonapplause I submit to you that if we stay strong  if we stay committed  if we remain true to our values  that one day  people will look back and they will say  "Who could ever have doubted that of course  the universal values of democracy and freedom would take hold in the Middle East?"
nonapplause And I've got some folks on the other side of the aisle that still think none of this should happen and  in fact  have said they're going to run on a platform of repeal.
nonapplause We understand the continuing dangers to civilization  and we have the resources  the strength  and the moral courage to overcome those dangers and lay the foundations for a better world.
nonapplause We have never had so much economic progress  social progress  political self-confidence as a nation -- I say "political " as citizens we're pretty confident -- with the absence of an overwhelming or paralyzing domestic crisis or foreign threat.
nonapplause We need you to educate your members about what the plan really is and what it isn't  because education is the key to understanding  and it's going to take phone calls to explain  to talk things through  to make sure that people understand not just what's at stake but what this all means.
nonapplause After all  we defend our nation we love.
nonapplause But nonetheless  despite the differences  day by day the degree of consensus  convergence was remarkable  surprising  and unanticipated.
nonapplause It's not always available.
nonapplause I'm heading there right now.
nonapplause '7E7E" And they agreed it was.
nonapplause You may have seen the portraits earlier this evening as you came in through the receiving line in the John Quincy Adams Room.

nonapplause I guess  John wanted me here to add a little charisma to the program.
nonapplause And today  we're going even further  proposing the development of a national standard for medium- and heavy-duty trucks  just as we did for cars and light trucks.
nonapplause Through all the events that came to define the 20th century  through all our moments of deepest hurt and brightest hope  Walter Cronkite was there  telling the story of the American age.
nonapplause This is a big deal  600 000 people every year get out of the penitentiary.
nonapplause So when you hear somebody say  well  we shouldn't do anything  and some political figures have said that -- some have said  well  we don't need to address this issue  we shouldn't worry about if there's no problem here  they're just trying to scare you.
nonapplause And we want that  also  to be a symbol for all the people in this country who are struggling to do the same thing.
nonapplause Bill  of course  had been working for President Ford for some time.
nonapplause Senator Bush  all of the distinguished guests here on this platform  and our friends here in New Haven  I want to say first of all what a very great privilege it is for my wife  Pat  and me to be here and to have such a beautiful day and a wonderful welcome from you.
nonapplause Government was everywhere: running up taxes  causing inflation  raising interest rates  and taking bigger and bigger shares of your earnings.
nonapplause Under the Democratic leadership in the Senate  the judicial confirmation process has become partisan  unreasonable and unfair.
nonapplause They provided large margins for the Balanced Budget Act in 1997  and for every other piece of progressive legislation that has passed  from the family and medical leave law to increasing the earned income tax credit to tax relief for working families.
nonapplause Can we pay for this tuition?
nonapplause You guys are still chillin back there?
nonapplause Do you remember those times?
nonapplause The church itself a year ago independently asked the Sandinistas for this dialog.
nonapplause This commitment to our forces and their families continues today.
nonapplause A new movement was stirring.
nonapplause We can help to get out of the way.
nonapplause We went through the process of a campaign  we had a lot of people say  gee  you shouldn't go for $1.6 trillion.
nonapplause Right now all around this country there are groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity  who are running millions of dollars of ads against Democratic candidates all across the country.
nonapplause And it gave a very clear account of the type of criminal activity that has been carried on by the mercenaries that are being paid by United States tax dollars.
nonapplause If you already have insurance -- and it seems that there are a lot of people who are worried that they'll lose what they have under this plan -- but under this plan  if you already have insurance  you're set.
nonapplause He sent out his legal adviser to chat with me--young fellow who scoffed at the idea that the Federalist Papers had anything worth considering in them.
nonapplause But they also wisely provided for an amendment process through which later generations could perfect the constitutional system.
nonapplause Some began to ask was that what trade unions had been established for?
nonapplause These partnerships work in interesting ways.
nonapplause And sometimes  even because of their political views.
nonapplause In addition to aiding Libya  Khan's network sold critical nuclear technologies to Iran and to North Korea.
nonapplause Now  the biggest obstacle between America and the future she deserves is -- and I think you've already guessed it -- special interests.
nonapplause All the major economic analyses are that we'll become economically advantageous for people to reinvest in cities again for new jobs in the future if we can take away the environmental problem.
nonapplause That must still be our inspiration and our purpose—to safeguard democracy in the cradle of the civilised world.
nonapplause And I can't help but noting that right here in Washington state  a lot of Congressional districts changed hands and went to the other party in 1994 because the people in the other party came out to small towns and rural areas in Washington and they said  the President and his party voted for that awful crime bill and they're going to take your guns away.
nonapplause One of the genuine pleasures of this job you've given me is being able to meet and talk with people like you all across this great land of ours.
nonapplause You're poised to be leaders in academia and industry; in finance and government.
nonapplause As you all know  we're at a critical juncture in the debate about health care in this nation.
nonapplause I believe we can grow the economy and protect the environment.
nonapplause I want to thank your Insurance Commissioner for the work he's done with my wife's Health Care Task Force to develop a health care system.
nonapplause I think the future of the United States is unlimited  and I say that after traveling to Maine on Friday  to the last frontier of Alaska on Saturday  and to the great industrial frontier of Michigan yesterday.
nonapplause His name is Bob Woodard.
nonapplause In Ghana where a new president is working with a great Peruvian economist  Hernando De Soto  to bring the assets of poor people in their homes  their houses  their farms  their businesses  into the legal system so they can be collateral for loans and they can grow their own families' incomes and the nation's income; where I met a woman who gave me a shirt made in a factory of 400 Ghanaians that came into being because of the Trade Bill I signed in 2000 in Nigeria where decades of corruption and poverty amidst all that oil wealth had led some of the states in desperation to adopt Shariya law under which a young mother of three was recently sentenced to death by stoning for bearing her last child out of wedlock and where I plead for her life.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President at Signing Of the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act
nonapplause I believe that God has given the people of our nation not only a chance  but a mission to prove to men and women throughout this world that people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds  of all faiths and creeds  cannot only work and live together  but can enrich and ennoble both themselves and our common purpose.
nonapplause But the Communists are not unopposed.
nonapplause The third thing I want to do is to do more to help our children read.
nonapplause And how wonderful a wife and mother she is.
nonapplause And productive jobs not only provide take-home pay; they provide self-respect.
nonapplause We've got to mount military operations whenever that's necessary and appropriate  in order to take out the bad guys before we can launch further attacks against the United States.
nonapplause And you've opened up the opportunities in trade to countries in sub-Saharan Africa  expanded trade in the Caribbean with our neighbors there.
nonapplause And we're standing with them and encouraging them to assume more of their own self-defense and to take the steps necessary for self-government.
nonapplause I must say that all the time when this country fails to educate a boy or girl  fails to make it possible for that boy or girl to go to college and get an education  fails to clean our rivers  fails to find employment for our people  fails to find research for new uses for our old commodities  fails to move this State and country ahead  that administration has failed the country  and I must say that I cannot believe in this great industrial State of Pennsylvania  which has seen in the last 8 years a recession in 1954  a recession in 1958  and now  just 2 years later  a partial recession in this State  and across the country.
nonapplause She has a deep knowledge of what the burden of crushing costs does to our families and businesses.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at the Pastor's Policy Briefing
nonapplause We will stay in Afghanistan and in Iraq to make absolutely certain the job is done before we move on.
nonapplause And it will make our recovery more fragile and our future less secure.
nonapplause During the dark days of World War II  Timken quickly adjusted its production line from steel tubes to gun barrels.
nonapplause And that will mean it's not just you bargaining with insurance companies  it's you and many other small business owners and self-employed individuals all across the country.
nonapplause Most people  if you ask them  say  “Give me a word that describes the modern world.” Most people who say that word is “globalization.” I much prefer the word “interdependence” because it implies more than economics  economics plus.
nonapplause But  but in that episode Jim actually saved my life.
nonapplause And on it are inscribed his words: "Among men  as among nations  respect for the rights of others is peace."
nonapplause Because we had clear  sharp  unambiguous message and people heard it.
nonapplause But I would urge those of you who are interested in it to get that  look at it  and think about what new work could be done to look into that.
nonapplause He ran for office  as he put it  "…to bring people together who had never been together before."
nonapplause And we've had honest debates and arguments and sometimes we still disagree  but we know we're moving the country in a certain direction and we know it works.
nonapplause Now  there've been times -- just a few years ago was one of them -- when we have been careless and things have slipped for America.
nonapplause And we're all safer today because Libya is no longer trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
nonapplause So let me tell you where I stand when it comes to the economy.
nonapplause Let us live by their example.
nonapplause They fail to see that no internal revolution has ever succeeded in overthrowing a government by violence unless the government had already lost the allegiance and effective control of its armed forces.
nonapplause We've got an education opportunity in this country with the diversity of our kids  but we also have an obligation.
nonapplause But  let me see--just to start out with  how many people here would call themselves Democrats?
nonapplause There's a lot out there to do when one fanatic can break open a vial of sarin gas in a subway station in Tokyo and kill hundreds of people; when one fanatic in the United States can get on the Internet and find through high-tech means the very low-tech way of making a bomb  like the bomb that destroyed the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
nonapplause I asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff one day if it wasn't possible that we  with our technology in this country  couldn't come up with a defensive system that could start erasing those missiles as they came out of their silos and that could give us a shield to protect us.
nonapplause And I got to see her commitment firsthand.
nonapplause I greet all the people of this great nation  of every race  color  creed  social condition.
nonapplause It's pretty darn good to be in the home of the world champion Boston Celtics.
nonapplause I also thought we ought to watch the film here in the East Room where the expedition really began.
nonapplause For a very small contribution  both the NEA and the NEH have made vital contributions to the life of this nation.
nonapplause First and foremost  NEPAD  the New Partnership for African Development  a truly African initiative with the responsibilities of African nations defined by Africa  not demanded by the West.
nonapplause And that's why we have to send another message -- one that can't be ignored.
nonapplause Thank you  Mayor  I appreciate you coming.
nonapplause I always enjoy the opportunity to come out and speak on behalf of a good member of the House of Representatives.
nonapplause Over time  failure to make such investments slowly degrades our competitiveness  leaving us without the skilled workforce or the technologies or the basic infrastructure that a 21st century economy requires.
nonapplause What does that mean?
nonapplause Still  we must try.
nonapplause Now  in this campaign I've heard the deficit called mine -- that it is so big.
nonapplause And after about 500 pages  he concludes with roughly these words: If anything can be learned from the history of economic development in the world  it is this--culture makes all the difference.
nonapplause And all the new money generated in this plan goes back to small businesses and middle-class families who can't afford health insurance.
nonapplause He's been a leader in increasing the number of Border Patrol agents  particularly those here in the state of Arizona.
nonapplause Or will you be thinking about good schools for your children  new homes for them  new businesses  the effort to create genuine self-government to eradicate corruption and violence and give your children the joys of a normal life?
nonapplause And as he said  it's kind of like airport metal detectors.
nonapplause President Bush once said he likes a place where a cowboy hat is part of the working uniform.
nonapplause Instead  it is a rare opportunity to prepare our nation for the challenges and the opportunities of the 21st century -- or in the words of the old saying  to fix the roof while the sun is shining.
nonapplause When you go home tonight I want you to think about this: you were standing and freezing your feet off in New Hampshire in '92  or you had to do some other kind of service above and beyond the call since then -- you gave us the chance to serve and your country has the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years.
nonapplause We must support our nation's police and emergency personnel  because the demands of your job are greater than ever.
nonapplause Well  if the history of our great nation and the character of this breed called American mean anything at all  it is that when we have believed in ourselves  when we pulled together  putting our wisdom and faith into action  we made the future work for us.
nonapplause Yet we understand that winning this war requires more than that.
nonapplause Not all that long before then  the great American singer  Marian Anderson  was denied the right to sing in Constitution Hall because of her race.
nonapplause That's a vital area of interest.
nonapplause I think we can do better  and I believe we are going to have to do better  or otherwise the United States is going to cease to lead.
nonapplause And finally  we will begin a national campaign to promote cybersecurity awareness and digital literacy from our boardrooms to our classrooms  and to build a digital workforce for the 21st century.
nonapplause It's the last time  of course  that I will address you under these same circumstances.
nonapplause But there's a gentle slope at the end of that Colonnade  a ramp that was installed during a renovation of the West Wing 75 years ago  making it much easier for one of my predecessors to get to work.
nonapplause And we've been the kind of nation our fathers and mothers defended in World War II; a great and diverse country  united by common dangers and by common resolve.
nonapplause I have seen the President make many great decisions in these last 7½ years.
nonapplause Among other things  it gets rid of the death tax so that small businesses  farms and ranches will be able to pass on to the next generation those things that you've worked for all your life to build and create without having Uncle Sam come in and take 55 percent of it in taxes the second time around.
nonapplause It's also a matter of national security.
nonapplause I want to make it clear that I wholly disagree with this view.
nonapplause And I appreciated his suggestion  and it's an interesting idea that I know that some in the Senate are looking at and some in the House are looking at.
nonapplause Throughout our hemisphere we see how drug cartels threaten the fabric of entire societies.
nonapplause On the other hand  any system taken to extremes is subject to abuse.
nonapplause But there are some things I think we need to think about that we learned from this endeavor as we look ahead to what still needs to be done.
nonapplause And I found out that I might stand there and talk all day  and I wasn't as effective as one individual who could stand up in front of them and say to them  "I've been there.
nonapplause Roger  thank you very much.
nonapplause I last visited Guam as Secretary of Defense.
nonapplause I promise you it won't be that much  barring some unforeseen development  because the Congress has spent a lot of money and because of the curious way that it's calculated.
nonapplause And we can never measure the value of what was gained in their sacrifice.
nonapplause The recruiting stations were places to stage protests.
nonapplause In other words  this is a chance to earn more -- watch your money grow in a better way through a conservative mix of bonds and stocks.
nonapplause Sixty years ago  few would have predicted the triumph of these values in Germany and Japan.
nonapplause In economics  there are no final victories.
nonapplause As a way to clarify the matter  Senator Kerry said  and again I quote  "I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause Then as now  we focused on the need to sort out responsibilities and turn back to States and localities many Federal programs  insisting they be accompanied by the resources to pay for them.
nonapplause Peace requires responsibility.
nonapplause No President has ever done that before.
nonapplause This beautiful city  founded nearly 500 years ago  reminds us that even in times of great change some things are meant to last -- our heritage  our love of family  community  our devotion to work  our respect for the land we are blessed to inhabit.
nonapplause Everybody does.
nonapplause They were neighbors.
nonapplause There will be no new jobs.
nonapplause When I traveled across this country last year and asked many  if not all of you  to support my campaign  I said that I believed the time was ripe for peace in the Middle East  but that it could not be achieved unless the President of the United States understood that in the end the United States could never impose a peace on the Middle East  but could only guarantee it if it were to occur.
nonapplause Natural gas needs to move in our hemisphere.
nonapplause Today  fewer than one in three students are enrolled in phys ed every day.

nonapplause There's nothing radical about what we've proposed.
nonapplause And when the bombs were dropped  they struck within ten meters of the target -- having been programmed for latitude  longitude  elevation  and even wind speed.
nonapplause Or author Emma Lazarus  who wrote powerful essays arguing against anti-Semitism and for the rights of immigrants.
nonapplause And you are continuing to tackle some of the most important issues facing our country.
nonapplause And because they do not have such beliefs  and because they present their case on purely materialistic grounds  America must remember that our greatest strength is in our moral and spiritual ideals and because those ideals are our greatest strength  it means that you  the people of this country  can do the most to preserve it.
nonapplause We froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers.
nonapplause And the spirit of the discussion we had was important for me to see and hear.
nonapplause And I've called on good men and women to do so.
nonapplause Let me give you an example.
nonapplause America is still an eagle  and she's ready to soar again.
nonapplause But to preserve the best of its achievements—remembering that it was created to ensure that western Europe was never again torn apart by conflict—and to put it on a sounder basis for the tasks ahead.
nonapplause The amendments to our Constitution that outlawed slavery and guaranteed the right to vote came at the price of a terrible civil war.
nonapplause I'm talking about Secretary of the Treasury Don Regan.
nonapplause I want to thank Les Brownlee who is with us  the Acting Secretary of the Army.
nonapplause Earlier  I quoted Adam Smith.
nonapplause We have  as you've been told already  thanks to the leadership of Bob Packwood and others in the United States Senate  a window of opportunity to pass one of the greatest tax reform packages in all our history.
nonapplause SDI is America's insurance policy to protect us from accidents or some madman who might come along  as Hitler did or a Qadhafi  or just in case the Soviets don't keep their side of a bargain.
nonapplause It seems that she has a schedule too.
nonapplause It is a difficult task  the task of leadership  to balance so many pressing needs and complex goals  to assess the claims of the future against those of the present  to stimulate the distinctive and cooperative roles of the public and the private sectors.
nonapplause We would go to $12 billion  and we found ways and means to achieve this within the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit targets.
nonapplause As you may know  the National Science Foundation and NASA provided funding for Dr. Paul Chu's landmark experiments at the University of Houston.
nonapplause See  that said it all  because that means that what we were dealing with here--they can make light of it if they like  they can joke about it if they want  they can say  "it was just sex as they pleased"--but what it really is  is the abuse of a human being as if they are a thing.
nonapplause And I've got this little mantra I tell everybody all the time.
nonapplause They'll have elections in January.
nonapplause The crews are out there refueling Air Force One.
nonapplause This is only a temporary step  the web site.

nonapplause "We hold these truths to be self-evident " they said  "that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  that to secure these rights  governments are instituted among men  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."
nonapplause Hundreds of young men died before they could struggle 20 feet into the red-tinged tide.
nonapplause And it took an international effort of Herculean proportions to stop people who were biologically indistinguishable from one another  but had different religions and had grown into different ethnic categories.
nonapplause And in an increasingly interconnected world  the diversity of our country is a powerful advantage in global competition.
nonapplause I don't know whether I can handle that or not.
nonapplause All doubt on that matter was removed by recent comments Senator Kerry made to The New York Times.
nonapplause If you read all the literature  the truth is nobody can be sure.
nonapplause These men and women serve on the front lines in the nation's fight against disease and poor health conditions.
nonapplause And that's what “Let's Move!” and the Building Healthy Communities initiative is really all about.
nonapplause What has all that got to do with this?
nonapplause And too many incumbents have come to believe that the key to continued access to the money for re-election is to stay on the good side of those who have the money to give.
nonapplause That's why I've charged our Federal Chief Performance Officer  Jeff Zients  who you already heard from  to work with Vivek and Aneesh  and all of you  to make sure the changes we make have a lasting impact.
nonapplause So thank you for the opportunity of being part of it.
nonapplause Doesn't this stand all decency an morality on its head?
nonapplause It is this fact that explains why the poverty-stricken nations of this hemisphere and Africa  filled with discontent in some cases  and social tensions  bearing the memory of past wrongs  have still not succumbed to the lure of communism.
nonapplause There is no evidence that we get better health outcomes.

nonapplause And of all those things that have happened  my fellow Republicans  how many of us could have imagined 8 or even 4 years ago that one day an American President would have an opportunity to stand  as I did a few months ago  there in the Lenin Hills at a podium at Moscow State University and tell the young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder and glory of human freedom?
nonapplause Our taxes might change some  and we recognize that this policy or that one could have some effect out here in Illinois.

nonapplause We also must set our sights on a more distant horizon.
nonapplause It must be able to look beyond next year's budget cycle and fund new technology we need over a multi-year period.

nonapplause We have an achievement gap in America that is not right and needs to be closed.
nonapplause Dearly.
nonapplause Fortunately this has not happened but the less willing and able we Europeans become to carry our share of the common burden  the less willing the Americans will be to man the defences with us.

nonapplause It means that how we train and recruit teachers in the first place  how do we match them up with master teachers so that they learn best practices; how do we make sure that if they're coming in and they don't have all the professional background they need in something -- a subject area like science  that we give them the training they need; and how do we recruit people who might be great teachers but didn't go through the conventional channels.
nonapplause And it is.
nonapplause And since the very beginning  we have worked hard with varying degrees of success and occasional  regrettable  sometimes painful failures  to weave the diverse threads of our nation into a coherent  unified tapestry.
nonapplause And we'll set a goal of eliminating all those “food deserts” within seven years.
nonapplause If you believe that your candidate is as good as I believe he is  if you believe that the issues are as important as I believe they are  if you believe he's on the right side of the issues  and most important of all  if you buy what I just said about the nature of this time  yes times are good  yes we are grateful -- but it just imposes on those of us who have done well enough to show up at this fundraiser tonight a bigger responsibility to see that we use these good times to prepare for our children's future.
nonapplause In 1991  when the incumbent President was at 75 percent approval  and I decided to make this race when nobody but my mother and my wife thought I could win  I did it because I was worried about my country and my capital.

nonapplause And we have a duty to solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all.
nonapplause But if I eat it all  I'll get sick.
nonapplause I must say we are delighted to have them all.
nonapplause You know  you hear all this talk about benefit cuts; we're talking about making sure benefits grow at the rate of inflation -- that's what we're talking about.

nonapplause How are we going to organize our lives so that people can work and still do their most important job  which is to raise their children properly?
nonapplause They became farmers and merchants  worked in mills and factories.
nonapplause But you know what  if you talk to most Americans on these issues  they're not thinking Republican  they're not thinking Democrat  they're not thinking liberal  they're not thinking conservative.
nonapplause The other party promises to create more government -- is there an echo in here?
nonapplause Part of this is the broader economy  but part of it is the practices of credit card companies.
nonapplause The fourth thing I think we have to do is to increase the capabilities of our allies to fight terror in their own neighborhoods.
nonapplause You know what he said?
nonapplause We must continue to emphasize those things that unite Americans rather than those things that divide them.
nonapplause And I want to thank my fellow Americans for coming out to say hello.

nonapplause Now  at that moment  Adams was the symbol for our country of the idea that the national government ought to take a stand against slavery  to strengthen the Union and to  in effect  apply the guarantees of the Constitution to the present moment -- in other words  to acknowledge that we were wrong when we started as a country and we said that black people were only three-fifths human and they didn't really count as citizens.
nonapplause We believe we have the program.
nonapplause We should recognize that we can't win an all-out fight when they have more money and they can demonize us.
nonapplause I've used this analogy before.
nonapplause And here is what has happened in 20 months -- we have made a good start on the economy; we have made a good start on crime; we have made a good start on making government work for ordinary Americans.
nonapplause I will do my best to support you as your Commander in Chief  and what you have done here is a credit to every American back home.
nonapplause And God bless them for what they're doing.
nonapplause It's not an issue.
nonapplause Thank you very much  and God bless you all.
nonapplause Well  indeed  they are failing  because of the policies of both parties.
nonapplause And each has its own track record.
nonapplause Well  I'm going to level with you.
nonapplause The policy of this government is to help entrepreneurship flourish  to help small businesses start.

nonapplause You should know that Then we've got to go get that $400 000 000 000 and we have a huge trade deficit  and we have to cover that.
nonapplause For God and our posterity  we will seek with our voices and with our vote to make the conscience of this nation whole  to make its character once again a character that responds to the will of God and to restore those ties of respect and obligation that as they must bind us to our heritage  so they must bind us to our future sleeping in the womb or lurking in our heart's imagination.
nonapplause Each of you  whom I love deeply  will know that my heart today is bursting with gratitude for all you have done for me.
nonapplause In order to maintain our freedom  to meet our commitments  to the Constitution  to the great moral principles enunciated by this country's leaders  we have to  as I say tonight  set a high example  and I believe it is the function of our party  the Democratic Party  in the early days of the l960's to move this country closer toward that example.
nonapplause First of all  thank you all for being here.
nonapplause And the third point I want to make  which is in fact the beginning of my talk  is that I see all of this in a larger context  and that of course is the larger context of the ongoing war against terror.
nonapplause We'll continue to make new investments in 21st century capabilities to meet new challenges.
nonapplause Now  no society has every fully solved this problem.
nonapplause And you reminded us all that aviation history is still being written by men and women with the spirit of adventure and derring-do.

nonapplause And that was just before the United States economy created more than 6 million new jobs in 21 months.
nonapplause On the domestic front  obviously  we've been through an economic period -- we had a recession that was kicking in just as the President and I were sworn in four years ago.
nonapplause And thank you for your generous support of his reelection.
nonapplause That won't work.
nonapplause I talked with our Ambassador  Reg Bartholomew  who  although injured himself  expressed pride on behalf of the dedicated Americans that were serving with him.
nonapplause And one of the people who performed was the comedian  Red Buttons  who must be -- I don't know how old he is now  but he's not a kid.

nonapplause But no one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own  nor dictate its terms to the world.

nonapplause And we have so many more ahead.
nonapplause After our nation was attacked on September the 11th  2001  America made a decision: We will not wait for our enemies to strike before we act against them.

nonapplause And when we see disease and starvation and hopeless poverty  we will not turn away.
nonapplause They said  oh  look  look  that's Obama's energy policy.
nonapplause And it's absolutely true -- it's absolutely true this is a middle-of-the-road bill.
nonapplause And that  very simply  is our task today.
nonapplause We will send observers to the election and we will form a balanced judgement on the basis of their report.
nonapplause So for decades  we've watched as efforts to solve tough problems fall prey to gamesmanship and partisanship  to the prosaic concerns of politics  the ever-quickening news cycle  to endless campaigns focused on scoring points instead of meeting our common challenges.
nonapplause And a special word of welcome to all the kids who are here from Horton's Kids in Anacostia  and all the rest of you who want to see one more turkey for Thanksgiving.
nonapplause As George said in his opening remarks  we've had some disagreements about this in the past.
nonapplause So I'd like to ask you before we begin the formal program today to join me in a moment of silent prayer for those students  for the other victims and for their families.
nonapplause I'm going to have to talk to Secret Service.
nonapplause Well  Virginia needs Wyatt Durrette's strong  principled leadership.
nonapplause And that was just before we lowered inflation from more than 12 to down around 4 percent.
nonapplause Doesn't that make you want to be one of his constituents again?
nonapplause And there is a second answer  which is that we still have some very profound challenges that  if left unmet  will come back to haunt us in the 21st century.
nonapplause And I know that you look at me  a candidate for the Presidency  and you say what's he going to offer us.
nonapplause You know  you're serving shoulder-to-shoulder with our NATO forces that are here.

nonapplause Many members of Congress wanted to be here  but they are actually voting now  and in the House they're voting on this  on amendments to this very proposal.
nonapplause Let us go at it in an imaginative way  in a bold way  because our trouble in the past is that we have been too timid  in my opinion  in attempting to strike at this problem.
nonapplause Today  these documents enjoy universal acclaim.
nonapplause I got a call last week from a very distinguished citizen of the world who said  "Well  Mr. President  for a lame duck  you're still quacking rather loudly."

nonapplause When one person gets sick  that has the potential of making us all sick.
nonapplause Important changes have come to America in the last 2\1/2\ years.
nonapplause But I also know that you count it as a privilege to look after some exceptional Americans  people who are willing to sacrifice for their country.
nonapplause And so  Coach  I appreciate the fact that you work hard with these players to make sure that they take advantage of this fantastic opportunity  and that is to be a student at the University of Florida.

nonapplause When I took office in January of 1993  there were only 50 sites on the Worldwide Web.
nonapplause All the way to the remarkable innovations now being dreamed up in the Dupont Labs.
nonapplause And obviously we need to do more to ensure that investments move beyond adding a charitable component to ensuring that development objectives are included in a business model.
nonapplause I'm sure you've heard the arguments -- I certainly have -- that  well  if you have a $1.6 trillion tax cut  the government is not going to be able to meet its needs; that by letting people keep their own money  the federal government is going to starve to death.
nonapplause And they're going to be buying more products and they're going to be buying more services.
nonapplause And if they are  we'll praise teachers like we should  all across the country.
nonapplause But in those days  its leaders didn't belong to the "blame America first" crowd.
nonapplause There's no room in the Republican Party for bigots  and the record shows that we've been firm in protecting civil liberties ever since entering office nearly 20 months ago.
nonapplause And in the end  I am hopeful that you will choose to make the changes that we need not just because they're good for your company  but because they're good for our country.
nonapplause But let me tell you about another couple I received.
nonapplause And what they also know is what won't happen.
nonapplause I know that but But you need to know that there's also a massive coordination effort for a good reason.
nonapplause Terrorists hide and strike within free societies  so we freeze their bank accounts  disrupt their plans  hunt them down one by one  until they can no longer threaten America and other free peoples.
nonapplause And that's how we'll move American students to the top of the pack in math and in science over the next decade  and guarantee that America will lead the world in discovery in this new century.
nonapplause For many years prior to 9/11  terror attacks against Americans were treated as isolated incidents  and answered -- if at all -- on an ad hoc basis  and rarely in a systematic way.
nonapplause And that being the case  I think we have a lot of thinking to do today  because I look at all those different alternatives in the race  and people keep asking me why it is that  supposedly with so little chance and so forth and so on  I'll stay in this race.
nonapplause Three years ago  there was a lot of talk about education reform  but there wasn't much action.
nonapplause And we've got to preserve that  and protect it  encourage it  make certain that going forward  we're able to sustain that same kind of progress.

nonapplause I was just in Kansas City -- let me just give you this example  because it's important  anybody can do this.
nonapplause You know the Republicans  they've never seen a corporate loophole they're not in love with.
nonapplause But by far more important  it's an election that will shape what America will be like when our children are our age.
nonapplause We know how to do this.
nonapplause Some had their questions  but were eventually persuaded that the American economy  and American families  would be better off if workers could keep more of their own money.
nonapplause And there will no doubt be difficult months ahead.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause It's always saved us money.
nonapplause So I say to you first  thank you because we have moved this country in the right direction.
nonapplause You've seen Mr. Khrushchev upon television.

nonapplause And you know a wonderful thing about the constitution of the state of Florida?
nonapplause Ray Shamie cares about the people of Massachusetts.
nonapplause Now  these are huge things.

nonapplause In every conversation we ever had  he never minced words  he never postured or pulled punches  he never shied away from tough issues or tough calls  and most important  he never shied away from doing what he believed was the right thing.

nonapplause Now  let me say in a more positive sense  we did those things hoping that we wouldn't be punished for them politically  but basically because we thought we were in a tight -- we had a terrible crime problem  we had a terrible economic problem; we had to do something about it.

nonapplause And what happened?
nonapplause And many insurance companies now settle even dubious claims out of court  fearing the excessive amounts that may result if they go to trial.
nonapplause And that's what has shaped our welfare reform proposal  and that's what we've come to hear about today.
nonapplause We have sought to make good on that obligation by crafting a defense strategy for our time.
nonapplause Well  we're doing a little better.
nonapplause But it is possible that financial crisis abroad could wreck that system  as farmers here found out when the Asian financial crisis hit a couple years ago.
nonapplause If you think that is a good record  stick with Mr. Nixon.
nonapplause Let me try to go back over some of what all of you said.
nonapplause In March  I was in Africa.

nonapplause Then he asked me if I'd bought it at a toy store.
nonapplause Now  we have clear goals for education.
nonapplause We've increased our original defense spending plans three times in three years  adding back almost $50 billion to ensure that we have the equipment  the training  the quality of life our troops deserve.
nonapplause Why don't we agree to it?
nonapplause Our country is working again and for that  and for the role all of you have played in it -- not only the governors and their staffs who are here  but all the others who are here  from the labor organizations and the education groups and the business groups -- I am profoundly grateful.
nonapplause And I'll bet on American technology any time.
nonapplause During the American Revolution  volunteers and Minute Men earned our freedom.

nonapplause For all that  as President and in my personal role as a citizen and a Christian  I am profoundly grateful.
nonapplause That's the only demographic group that we held steady in all the ones I didn't mention.
nonapplause But what you need to know is that's the sort of leadership we have in our party.
nonapplause But by doing so  we simply invited more danger.

nonapplause Productivity is high.
nonapplause We will be against a spendthrift government that digs deeper and deeper into the pockets of our people  that controls more and more of their income  that deprives them of the ability to save and build up resources that they could hand on to their children  because that would violate our obligation to our posterity.

nonapplause And when you combine that with the fact that there is so much mobility in this society  much more than ever before.

nonapplause One final thing: I want to let each and every one of you know how personally grateful I am for your being here and for all that you're doing for the cause.

nonapplause This is madness.
nonapplause And so we're going to keep moving forward with a clear  comprehensive  pro-growth agenda.
nonapplause But in order to do that  we need to reinvigorate our flagging manufacturing sector  usher in a new era of environmental efficiency  support small businesses that help the economy  and intensively rebuild our infrastructure.
nonapplause Well  let me tell you something  folks -- here are the options.
nonapplause I think we're going to do the right thing.
nonapplause To accept the view that action by America and our allies can be stopped by the objection of foreign governments that may not feel threatened  is to confer undue power on them while leaving the rest of us powerless to act in our own defense.
nonapplause I'm glad to be here with all of you.
nonapplause I worry right now!

nonapplause But the thing I have tried to say  with all the time that I have spent on foreign policy  and military policy  and trade policy  that I must say it's an absolutely fascinating time to be President  and a great honor  actually  to be President in this difficult time  to try to construct the framework for the post-Cold War world.

nonapplause The crime rate is going down in almost every city in the country.

nonapplause We should look for an economic policy that helps business and labor.
nonapplause And then all the feelings and thoughts about ‘Where do we go from here?'.
nonapplause I'm trying to pass a juvenile justice bill in the Congress which will give communities the resources and the help they need to try to restore civility and calm and order to the lives of our young people.

nonapplause We are just temporary occupants.
nonapplause And every time I sat with the Leader -- I never called Senator Byrd “Senator ” I always called him “Leader” -- when I sat with the Leader  I could see that look in his face and he said  “Joe  you sure you're making the right decision giving up the Senate for Vice President?”   Because as the senators know  he revered the Senate.

nonapplause Yesterday in the church that Hillary and I attend they observed Dr. King's birthday with some special music.
nonapplause I ran for President because we were in the midst of 30 years of social problems  20 years of economic problems  and 12 years of the kind of stuff she's going through now -- where the leadership of this country would always tell the American people what they thought they wanted to hear.
nonapplause And the ideas we have for the future are good ideas.
nonapplause And it is the heart of a people governed by respect for the Ten Commandments and the word of God writ upon their hearts--it is the heart of such a people that fits them for a freedom that will endure.
nonapplause In other words  the benefits -- Americans would get more money to save and more money to invest.

nonapplause Freedom still has enemies in Iraq.
nonapplause And I only dealt with two today  on health care and the economy  but as I said  I could have gone on about the environment  and education  and nuclear arms control -- where the differences are breathtaking  and I think very troubling.

nonapplause I say that because in a very real sense the State of California in the last decade has experienced the same problems which the United States will experience over a period of 50 years  tremendous growth  tremendous economic change  development of your natural resources  the effect of a war economy and a peace economy on this State  the necessity of building new schools  of educating our children here in California  the necessity of meeting the needs of our older citizens  particularly in the field of medical care.
nonapplause I believe  since almost every parent in America has to work to make ends meet  whether in a one- or a two-parent household  it is perfectly acceptable to require people on welfare who can work to work.
nonapplause The United States backed your vision with our sustained diplomatic  economic and military cooperation.
nonapplause And most dangerously  we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam  and who attacked my country from Afghanistan.
nonapplause The terrorists who struck America are ruthless  they are resourceful  and they hide in many countries.
nonapplause It's bad news  politically  for the Republican Party.
nonapplause And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner  and never your patron.
nonapplause He understands what he needs to say but he just doesn't grasp what he needs to do.
nonapplause These folks understand courage.

nonapplause We had quadrupled the debt of the country in 12 years.
nonapplause We all quote their numbers  and we quote them even when they don't agree with what we wanted to do  because they are bipartisan; they are responsible.
nonapplause Will you forgive me if I offer some reminders?
nonapplause But when you look at the fact that with the baby boomers retiring  the oldest of the baby boomers -- that's me  we turn 65 in 2011  not that far away -- there are going to be a lot more people retired relative to the number of people working  which means there will be a lot more people drawing Social Security and a lot more people drawing Medicare relative to the number of people working.
nonapplause To get it growing again  we've delivered significant tax relief for the American people.
nonapplause I told them  when we got it back there in the back -- they said they were nervous.
nonapplause So parents  family members  I promise you  your love and encouragement and unconditional support will be enough  as well.
nonapplause I go through all of this because I feel myself always in a little bit of an awkward position when I come into a state like this to campaign for people  because after all is said and done  I believe in federalism  and I think that the folks we send off to Washington from Utah's Second District  and from Utah's First District  ought to be people that reflect the views and choices of the people of Utah.
nonapplause On occasion you will hear this called a domestic surveillance program or eavesdropping.
nonapplause What are we going to do for all these children?
nonapplause Well  good afternoon.
nonapplause Possibly some of you remember drilling with wooden guns and doing maneuvers with cardboard tanks.
nonapplause And it's hard to rewire them after that.
nonapplause Indeed  it may be the most crucial intangible upon which our prosperity depends.
nonapplause Well  he got a lot of laughs and he did better than most.
nonapplause My staff never lets me do that.
nonapplause We knew that inflation  the quiet thief  was stealing our savings.
nonapplause I'm taking that for granted.
nonapplause Some have argued that democracy is somehow unsuited for Asia or at least for some nations in Asia -- that human rights are relative and that they simply mask Western cultural imperialism.
nonapplause Today  we have further evidence of just how well it is working.
nonapplause But we are going into a new age  and we can no longer have a top-down bureaucracy that is too heavy with management  that delivers too few services and is too oriented toward yesterday's top-down regulation.
nonapplause We support its goals and the principles upon which it is based.
nonapplause Churchill looms so large it is tempting to find in his life and labours easy analogies  easy answers to the new and vexing problems we face today.
nonapplause And thank you all.
nonapplause I'd also like to thank my good friend Mack McLarty for working so hard with the Vice President as the co-chair of our White House Task Force on the Olympic Games.

nonapplause One night  Vinton Cerf  who sent the first e-mail to his profoundly deaf wife  now 22 years ago  and Eric Ladner  a biologist and genome expert from Harvard  came to talk about how the digital chip made possible the sequencing of the human genome.
nonapplause And they all said  no.
nonapplause I've been luckier than most people because I had family who loved me  friends who took care of me  folks who worked with me and made me look better than I deserved  and a chance to do work I loved.
nonapplause That is our purpose here today.
nonapplause I believe we move forward.
nonapplause We have to teach our children why ugly words and awful violence  why desecrated synagogues and bombed buildings wound us all  something that I know that your World Of Difference campaign is doing for millions already.
nonapplause I run against a candidate  Mr. Nixon  who runs on the slogan "You never had it so good."
nonapplause We have to assume they will make further attempts inside the United States.
nonapplause He was forever there  reporting through world war and cold war; marches and milestones; scandal and success; calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know.
nonapplause And we recognize that after all this time  Henry David Thoreau was right: that government is best which governs least.
nonapplause This morning  when I got up  I saw the Prime Minister of Ethiopia on television  discussing the agreement the United States helped to broker there  between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
nonapplause And of course  shortly after that the attack of 9/11 came along and really shook the economy.
nonapplause This new law formally establishes that position and empowers the coordinator to set clear and uniform voluntary standards for the use of Amber Alerts across our country.
nonapplause And like all great art  a great country song also has a commitment to truth -- to telling the truth like it is  without pulling any punches.
nonapplause I know it's a very important debate  but I must say when the President and I talk about the state of the economy  recession dating is not what motivates us most.
nonapplause And I can tell you  I'm going through this now -- Meredith Cabe is one of my pardon attorneys -- just dealing with the mechanics of this  I just don't -- most people who apply for a presidential pardon do it because they want to vote again.
nonapplause Megan's Law was named after a seven-year-old girl from New Jersey who was taken at the beginning of her life.
nonapplause Because for 30 years we saw the violent crime rate triple and the aggregate size of America's police force only went up 10 percent.
nonapplause The president's policy in Iraq precipitated the very problem that he said he was trying to prevent.
nonapplause So with that  let me turn this over to President Préval.
nonapplause I think that's part of the -- part of the dialogue is to make sure everybody understands.
nonapplause If you don't  you're a legitimate target  even if you're just a 6-year-old girl going to work with her mother at the World Trade Center on the morning of September the 11th.
nonapplause We have established a new orthodoxy.
nonapplause They've been having a series of hearings.
nonapplause You know  in the last half-century  the cause of liberty has made great strides in this country  and around the world.
nonapplause So  on that evening  I was once again left wondering why it is that we seem to still have a crop of leaders and public figures who don't want to tackle the true moral agenda  who don't want to deal  forthrightly  with those issues which constitute the moral crises that we all know in our hearts is destroying our republic.
nonapplause That will juice the economy again  but have no long-term impact on the deficit.
nonapplause I said  why you?
nonapplause As I walked through the camp  young children picked up a chant  "USA  USA  USA."

nonapplause Who are the people who make America?
nonapplause And our coalition continues to train more Iraqi forces to assume increasing responsibility for their nation's security.
nonapplause Last year  more businesses failed than at any time in memory.
nonapplause I think it should serve people.
nonapplause To have a Republican President and the Congress and the President fighting over the next 4 years  without any legislation  without this country moving ahead  I believe the American people are going to choose to go with the Democrats again.
nonapplause We'll start with an initial investment of $400 million a year.
nonapplause Times are tough out here.
nonapplause I believe it's important to open up markets.
nonapplause They aren't a case to be handled  which they would be if they were in the hands of the government agencies  but a soul to be cherished.
nonapplause He had finally figured out a design for a new lighting fixture that made it possible to produce twice the light using half the energy.
nonapplause Again  if anybody thinks it doesn't matter whether the North Koreans have nuclear weapons I think you're wrong about that.
nonapplause Our own nation has the greatest potential to benefit from the emerging economy  but to do so we have to confront the obstacles that stand in our way.
nonapplause Again  you don't have to agree with me but should figure out how you view these things and you should be optimistic.
nonapplause Well  ladies and gentlemen  Secretary Bell and Dr. David Gardner and distinguished guests and  most especially  distinguished students  I want to thank all of you for coming here today on this beautiful day.
nonapplause But he chaired a commission that coughed up a number of good ideas.
nonapplause Madam Speaker  Vice President Biden  members of Congress  distinguished guests  and fellow Americans:
nonapplause We'd all be sitting there talking about and exchanging anecdotes about the impact of illegal immigration on our community  and how it's affecting things and how it's hurting things and it's changing things  and how it's disappointing folks because it has lead to an increasing sense that Americans are no longer in control of this country  that we are no longer at the helm in a country where the government of the people  by the people  for the people is supposed to be the rule--but is now respected by who?
nonapplause If it was ever true that Federal employees had greater capabilities than their local counterparts  those days are rapidly coming to an end.
nonapplause You all look beautiful in your black ties and ball gowns.
nonapplause I thank the foundations that have helped us.
nonapplause I know you guys have spent a lot of time with the troops  and supporting the troops and the men and women of the armed forces  especially those who are in Afghanistan and Iraq and a lot of other places around the world.
nonapplause They don't go shopping.
nonapplause One of her students also sent me a letter where he proudly told me that an eggplant is actually fruit and then letting me know that he now eats apples and pretzels instead of chips and candy  which is always good to hear.
nonapplause I grew up in a state where more than half the folks have a hunting or a fishing license  or both.
nonapplause Some say that the genius of America is in its productivity economically and  of course  that's one of the wonders of the world.
nonapplause There shouldn't be any question about this -?
nonapplause Upon selection the newly created Arab business network will match winners with established business leaders from around the world so they can implement their plan.
nonapplause The fact is what we're engaged in here is a global conflict.
nonapplause In your history books you've read about the Industrial Revolution.
nonapplause Lee  they tell me that you sported rather long hair in those days.
nonapplause As long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard  as long as there are millions of Americans who are not even paid a $1 minimum wage  as long as there are older people over the age of 65 who live on an average social-security check of less than $78 a month  as long as there are people around the world who wish to be free but are not free  as long as there are people around the world who are fighting to maintain their independence  as long as there are people who look to us for leadership  I believe we can serve.
nonapplause I discovered how my own improbable story fit into the larger story of America.
nonapplause Doesn't that make you want to be a constituent of his?
nonapplause And we did it in a way -- this is the most important thing to me -- it was good for everybody.
nonapplause But I would like to just reiterate what has already been said by previous speakers and make one other point.
nonapplause Yet as the entire world saw in the elections three weeks ago  the people of Iraq are determined to defend their freedom  and they will not permit a small group of assassins to subvert the will of the peaceful majority.
nonapplause Well  I found out that it's not so much that our opponents have a poor memory for their ruinous past  they've just a got a darn good "forgetory."
nonapplause But I'm not so sure.
nonapplause By now a unit of American soldiers has -- but now a unit of American soldiers has taken the Hiba School under its wing.
nonapplause And  now  as we move out of the Industrial Age into a time that will be far less centralized  far less dominated by large organizations  at least in terms of employment  and far more dominated by new forms of communications and technology  we have to once again examine these three questions and ask ourselves  how will we preserve our liberty?
nonapplause And today  even after more than five years of unrelenting action  this Department continues to wage the war on terror systematically and decisively.
nonapplause Economic systems work when access to opportunity is fair so that those with talent and drive can prosper.
nonapplause We have pledged 430 million to the global environmental facility for its second phase -- the largest contribution of any nation in the world.
nonapplause And then there are people who happen to be in certain sectors of the economy where they're being downsized and it's taking them a much longer time to find another job making what they were making before with the same level of benefits.
nonapplause And our black musicians continue to inspire us and bring us together.
nonapplause Now  we're not in power now because they failed to gain electoral support over the past 50 years.
nonapplause So I've invaded your dinner.
nonapplause He gave all to his job  and the nation gave him two terms.
nonapplause What?
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President and the Vice President at Dnc Dinner
nonapplause We needed to broaden our base and prove that we could spend tax money with discipline  grow the economy  be tough on crime and bring the American people together across regional and racial and party lines  and move the country forward.
nonapplause That's why I'm so glad that Joan and her family joined us here today.
nonapplause So if you agree with them  that you think it would be a good idea if America withdrew from all these global arms control regimes and stop trying to reduce the danger of nuclear weapons and say  we'll just have bigger weapons  we don't care what anybody else does -- then you should support the Republicans for the Senate.
nonapplause Let me say to this class  I know that the rewards of serving on the front lines of our foreign policy may seem distant and uncertain at times.
nonapplause I know you have an exciting weekend coming up.
nonapplause A friend of mine named Lonny Thompson at Ohio State is the leading expert on mountain glaciers in the world and he goes there every so often.
nonapplause Now  for a lot of folks  they'll yawn and say  gosh  that's $1 980  that's really nothing.
nonapplause It ensures that the cost of reviewing and approving drugs is shared between industry and government.
nonapplause Although unemployment is still too high  it's coming down rapidly  and we'll continue to chip away and knock that statistic down to size.
nonapplause What are we going to say if we walk away from our obligation to run the Medicare trust fund out until 2025 or beyond  and to provide all these elderly people -- not all of them poor  a lot of them middle class -- a little help in dealing with the prescription drug program?
nonapplause That's the good news.
nonapplause All of us together are just part of a great revolution  and it's a revolution that's only just begun.
nonapplause We have come treading our paths
nonapplause And I hope all of you will always be very proud of the role you have played in this special day.
nonapplause That's their argument.
nonapplause We are trying to create the conditions in which the economic expansion -- which has so benefited so many millions of Americans -- can reach people who have been left behind for decades.
nonapplause If my opponent's campaign were a television show  it would be "Let's Make a Deal."
nonapplause Laws like Arizona's put huge pressures on local law enforcement to enforce rules that ultimately are unenforceable.
nonapplause And he had been quite a speaker out along the mashed-potato circuit  always telling of his adventures in surviving that great flood.
nonapplause This honor is named  of course  for our 26th Secretary of Commerce  Malcolm Baldrige.
nonapplause We simply cannot escape each other  and that's all interdependence means.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause We can do this.
nonapplause The Young American Medal for Bravery is so special that the law mandates that it be given to the recipients only by the President of the United States and is to be given to no more than two young people a year.
nonapplause It also means that when a global economy gets in trouble  as Asia got in trouble  Russia got in trouble  and our friends and trading partners and people we hope will remain democracies need money  they can get the money they need at lower cost because we won't be out there taking it away from them.
nonapplause That same kind of spirit is found among the people in Afghanistan  in Angola  in Poland  and among all those who resist dictatorships.
nonapplause Well  now  I was a little surprised -- but not entirely surprised because he once did the same favor for me.
nonapplause We've got a lot of challenges in the world.
nonapplause If you're a Christian  Jew or Muslim  you're equally American.
nonapplause I just want to make a couple of other points -- I don't want to keep you late  and most of you have heard me give a lot of speeches.
nonapplause Well  good morning.
nonapplause Adams wrote home to his wife  telling her about a prayer he had composed for the president's house.
nonapplause For those who are about to retire  getting close to retirement age  they're going to be fine.
nonapplause I'll say it  then you say it.
nonapplause Well  welcome to the White House.
nonapplause Those of us in public office have serious responsibilities.
nonapplause My goal is to get to all of them.
nonapplause A reformed and effective Indonesian military is in the interest of everyone  because threats to our common security have not disappeared.
nonapplause Now  the question we must seriously ask ourselves--and I know that at moment I ask it with some risk to my so-called political fortunes  but I still think it has to be raised.
nonapplause We are working to deny weapons of mass destruction to outlaw states and their terrorist allies.
nonapplause The efforts to achieve peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis encountered many difficulties since the Madrid Conference in October 1999  and progress and regression  breakthroughs and setbacks  but the occupation of the Palestinian Territory remains an independent -- an independent Palestinian state is yet -- remains a dream in the conscious of the Palestinian people.There is no doubt that this situation should raise great frustration and anger among our people  for it is no longer acceptable or conceivable on the verge of the second decade of the third millennium that we fail to achieve just and true peace -- peace that would put an end to the century of conflict  fulfill the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people  lift the occupation  allow for the establishment of normal relations between the Palestinians and Israelis.
nonapplause He said  "I'm 87."
nonapplause Vice President Bush reaffirmed our commitment to serious  mutual  and verifiable arms reductions.
nonapplause This was quite a bold move.
nonapplause But there is one problem with this analysis.
nonapplause And the challenge to labor is clearly the same thing.
nonapplause We've set in place a tax program that will leave hundreds of billions of dollars in the pockets of working people that would have been grabbed away by built-in tax increases.
nonapplause If that grain isn't sold to the Soviets  most of it will be stockpiled  costing the taxpayers and depressing grain prices here at home.
nonapplause She had aspired to a career as a classic pianist  and then  shortly after graduation  developed a tendonitis that made the career that she trained for and wanted impossible.
nonapplause Those who attacked America have proven their eagerness to kill innocent men  women  and children by the thousands.
nonapplause Nope.
nonapplause We've got to learn to trust people like Father Cunningham and Linda Butler  and other people at the grass-roots level who are producing jobs.
nonapplause I was nominated for President  effectively  on June 2  1992  because I won the California  Ohio  and New Jersey primaries  and numerically had enough votes to win the nomination on the first ballot.
nonapplause And if I start slacking off  you can email me and tell me to get myself into gear.
nonapplause That's why we want a patients' bill of rights  basically to say  okay  let's manage the system  but let's put the health care of our people first and let medical decisions be made by medical professionals  not accountants.
nonapplause These are jobs building more fuel-efficient cars and trucks to make us energy independent.
nonapplause But anyone who believes as I do that this country will never be strong in the world  that we will never be successful in turning Mr. Khrushchev back  we will never be successful in expanding freedom around the world unless we have in this country a strong and vital and progressive society  and that is what we are committed to  that is what we are committed to  and I believe the American people on November 8  faced with a choice of a leadership that looks to the past and the present  and recognizing that this country  the only hope of freedom that there is  we are the only sentinel at the gate  and if we don't move ahead  if we don't provide employment for our people  if we don't use our facilities to the fullest  if we don't educate our children and provide under social security medical care for our aged and jobs for those in between  then the United States  instead of being the leader of the free world  will cease to count as the only hope of freedom.
nonapplause And we see the same spirit.

nonapplause And that's been operating since the mid '80s.
nonapplause Many of us after September the 11th  learned a lot about the madrassahs  the religious schools in Pakistan along the Afghan border where children are more likely to be indoctrinated than educated  but most people don't know why they have so many and why so many children go.
nonapplause It also means that as we transition in Iraq  that the one thing I will insist upon for however long I remain President of the United States is that we serve you and your families as well as you served us.
nonapplause We simply have to continue to expand the frontiers of the global economy.
nonapplause And that's why we're not going to quit.
nonapplause That's what this whole debate is about.
nonapplause Mike first learned the value of a job when he was 14 and employed as an entry-level salad bar worker at a local restaurant.

nonapplause But the days and weeks ahead will be full of arduous work and they will not be free of danger.
nonapplause Now  do we have problems at home and abroad?

nonapplause They were often denied even the comfort of suffering together.
nonapplause The difference is that I have a faith in individual enterprise.

nonapplause Then they hit us inside the United States on September 11th and killed 3 000 of our fellow citizens.
nonapplause And I just want to -- I have said this in other places  but I have -- I believe I have a good grasp on the institution of the vice presidency  and I can tell you it is my judgment that he has had far more positive impact in practical ways on the way the American people live as Vice President than any other person as Vice President in the history of the nation  by a good  long ways.

nonapplause Well  this is why I've said over and over again it's time to give the President what 43 Governors have  what I had when I was Governor of California: the ability to veto spending project by project  a line-item veto.
nonapplause You will understand what I mean.

nonapplause -- -- and their era will just be beginning.
nonapplause But  if this is true  then it is equally wrong for a school board to ignore the counsel of educators and not meet with them in a mutual atmosphere of good faith to arrive at a fair answer with regard to the problems of professional pay and working conditions.

nonapplause That's been true of the last 30 years  and we project that it will be just as true  more so even as we go forward from this point on.
nonapplause Because if you don't have a health care strategy  the American people can't stay well  the American economy can't get well  and you cannot reduce the deficit to zero in this decade.

nonapplause We had some new ideas  but the main thing we brought to Washington was an old idea -- arithmetic.
nonapplause He marries a wonderful Irish Catholic woman  has to beautiful Irish Catholic boys.
nonapplause This morning in the course of our discussions  I realized anew what I have long known: that Sweden and America share the same basic values and the same hopes for a more peaceful and prosperous world.
nonapplause The members of this resistance have chosen to separate themselves from their families and homes; to live in conditions of immense hardship  often with scant water and food; and to expose themselves to the dangers of battle.
nonapplause I can't do it alone.
nonapplause That's an effort that  under Secretary Shinseki's leadership  all of you have already begun -- conducting a thorough review of your operations all across this agency.
nonapplause Do you know we that have a national historic site here in Anacostia that is Frederick Douglass's home  that he lived in from after the Civil War  until he died  that I urge all of you to go see  if you haven't -- I'll flak for the National Park Service a little.
nonapplause They have no standing armies or navies.
nonapplause Second  we must make sure that every child has a safe and enriching place to go after school.
nonapplause And the third thing I want to say is that Mary and a lot of her colleagues have supported our efforts to raise education standards.
nonapplause Yet some of the very senators who voted to send him to the Iraqi theater tried to pass a resolution opposing those reinforcements.
nonapplause So have we.
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause Do you know what he said?
nonapplause We the people  collectively  are still the key to the survival of America's democracy.
nonapplause Former Vice President Mondale will succeed Ambassador Michael Armacost  whose service was very valuable.
nonapplause We made adoption much more attractive.
nonapplause We've still got a lot of work to do.
nonapplause That is how we all have to begin to think about our future.
nonapplause Nor will we lose sight of what is at stake.
nonapplause We recognize that in this administration we have kept down the cost of living to one-fifth of what it went up in that period.
nonapplause We believed that  first of all  we had to ground our party in the values that made our country great and the values that our party embodied when we were the leading party in America; that we were for opportunity for everybody  we were for responsibility from everybody and we thought we had to build an American community of everybody; and that this country wouldn't work if we couldn't do those three things; and that  basically  the debate which was going on in the early '90s in this country I thought was largely irrelevant to the real problems of real people -- when we had unemployment high  crime rising  welfare rising  incomes diverging  the country showing uncertainty around the world  and great difficulties.
nonapplause I was lucky enough to have parents who cared about me  but I was never strong enough to step up to somebody big and say  can I just sit down and meet with you?
nonapplause Have we ever had a clearer mandate?
nonapplause And  my friends  isn't that what we want for our children and grandchildren?
nonapplause It is impossible to describe to someone who has never been a part of it what it is like to have the right wing go after you and tell the world that you are just no good.
nonapplause I couldn't stand here today  except I remembered that there was a time when the majority and the law enslaved my people  and there were people of conscience who stood against that slavery  though it meant that they defy those laws!
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause The United States is committed to peaceful progress.
nonapplause Since 9/11  we have dismantled terrorist cells in Oregon  New York  North Carolina  and Virginia.
nonapplause So it's -- every year -- and inflation -- so every year we get some revenue growth.
nonapplause Thank you very much  Attorney General Reno  Ray Kelly  Father O'Donovan.
nonapplause It defined our freedom  our opportunity  and our strength.
nonapplause And I don't think that's hard to see.
nonapplause It's truly one of the outstanding Senate delegations in Washington.
nonapplause This had to do with a fellow that applied to the zoo for a job.
nonapplause You're Republicans here.
nonapplause And that retailer has to purchase those supplies from manufacturers –- as I said  most of them located right here in the United States of America.
nonapplause Al Gore's Reinventing Government project was the instrument through which we put that principle into practice.
nonapplause And that was a very nice introduction he gave.
nonapplause The resulting devastation damages the habitats of endangered species  causes flooding and soil erosion  harms air quality  oftentimes ruins water supplies.
nonapplause But let us get back to London  where failure is even more obvious on the question of both international policy and political cooperation.
nonapplause Among us senior citizens alone  more than 400 000 have been lifted out of poverty.
nonapplause Mr. Nixon has not understood that.
nonapplause I believe the thing that's interesting to note is  a beneficiary  of course  is UPS.
nonapplause I loved being in New Hampshire and I loved your support.
nonapplause Secretary Riley and Secretary and Mrs. Bentsen  Deputy Secretary of Education Madeleine Kunin.
nonapplause And while I'm talking about the actions taken by Congress  I want to single out the individuals in Congress who have been so remarkably supportive of this and have made it all possible.
nonapplause That doesn't mean that people aren't scared.
nonapplause Now  for all of you older folks like me who are not great computer geniuses  let me tell you what that means in practical terms.
nonapplause So  God bless you all.
nonapplause How did this happen?
nonapplause One had just become a citizen  was a native of Iran; another was a native of Sierra Leone; another was a native of Peru; another a native of Scotland.
nonapplause Ours is just televised.
nonapplause Producing a higher quality product at a lower cost will help the auto and other heavy industries meet their competition  benefit your other customers.
nonapplause Well  that never did happen.
nonapplause Or you can mentor a child.
nonapplause I believe that many Trades Unionists will share another concern that we have:
nonapplause Our country has never been stronger or our economy so vital.
nonapplause How will we manage that?
nonapplause George and I have seen first hand the good and generous hearts of the American people.
nonapplause We must never make a concession without getting one in return.
nonapplause We drop the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent  and increase the child credit from $500 to $1 000 per child.
nonapplause That's not debatable.
nonapplause He updated us on these latest efforts to stop the leak  mitigate the damage to the great beaches of the Gulf coast  and I had the chance to visit with -- Charlotte -- a beach like Port Fourchon that gives you a sense of what extraordinary efforts are being made at the local level  but also the damage that we're already starting to see as a consequence of this spill.
nonapplause I'm just one person.
nonapplause We want to confirm and build on the agreements reached there.
nonapplause It was so bad that experts of all political persuasions feared a second coming of the Great Depression.
nonapplause The world has never before  never in all of human history  had to do this.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by Vice President Richard M. Nixon  Following Arrival at International Airport  Honolulu  Hawaii
nonapplause They know them all by heart and reel off the facts and figures  claiming that this is the rich harvest of the Communist system.
nonapplause I look out here in this sea of faces and I wonder how many thousand stories there are here tonight -- stories of triumph and heroism and struggle against the odds  to overcome some racial or economic or other handicap -- how many of you have lost a loved one to violence or other tragedies.
nonapplause And with outstanding judges like Anthony Kennedy  Sandra Day O'Connor  and Antonin Scalia  we're showing that  despite what the liberals may think  America's most basic  fundamental values are not unconstitutional.
nonapplause Last year we exported £108 billion.
nonapplause It works in urban areas  it works in rural areas.
nonapplause The point I want to make about it is simply this.
nonapplause I believe that we are on the road to changing this country.
nonapplause I figured if we could get the economy going again that we'd create more millionaires.
nonapplause Here in the Midwest there's no drought.
nonapplause That makes my collar feel a little tighter --   -- and a lot smaller than some I see  because Dr. Franklin is not only considered one of the greatest preachers in America  but he is now also responsible for educating some of the greatest preachers in America.
nonapplause Then came the attack on the Saudi National Guard Training Center in Riyadh in 1995; the killings at Khobar Towers in 1996; the attack on our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; and  of course  the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.
nonapplause Also we have a clear reminder that we who are white are a minority in this global world  and all those over the world who are colored are now reaching greater and greater power  the whole course of history for the past 150 years has been toward freedom.
nonapplause Maybe I got 95% of my voters here today.
nonapplause They say our nation cannot afford to provide discounts to these institutions of learning and health by raising a billion dollars or so a year from service charges on telecommunications companies -- something that was agreed to in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both Houses.
nonapplause Ending our dependence on foreign oil  reforming our immigration system  rebuilding the Gulf Coast  and keeping our country safe from terrorism are not easy tasks  but they're absolutely vital goals.
nonapplause Just the opposite  as a matter of fact.
nonapplause I was down the other day in Missouri with the governor  and we were with an emergency room nurse  a male  who was 6'1"  weighed 230  looked like he could bench-press me on a cold day.
nonapplause Those are the things that I believed.
nonapplause By the time those twelve years were up  it was close to $300 billion per year.
nonapplause These are jobs designing and manufacturing and selling and installing more efficient building materials -– because 40 percent of the energy we use is used by our homes and buildings.
nonapplause A lot of people think  I had a tough time in the '80s and things are going well now  and why don't we just relax and let things rock along.
nonapplause The Bible has a passage  "they built an ambush for themselves."
nonapplause It's about educating people so that they can better educate themselves.
nonapplause But we will pay a terrible price if we do not.
nonapplause Should all his ambitions be realized  the implications would be enormous for the Middle East  for the United States  and for the peace of the world.
nonapplause But one thing sort of surprised me -- I learned that as a young man you were drawn to a life of the cloth.
nonapplause Even more  he owes it to our troops and their families whose sacrifice is a testament to the best of America.
nonapplause Tell me how you do it  Ross.
nonapplause If we are going to bring our budget deficit into balance  which will be good for all of us; if we're going to have to over a period of years cut back on expenditures that the government used to make  that makes it even more important for people who do go out into the private sector and work full-time  play by the rules  and want to make their own way without public assistance  to be rewarded for that work.
nonapplause It's a small delegation  but it was quality.
nonapplause You know  when I remarked about Democrats being present  Leon and myself having been Democrats  seriously  I think it is time to point out that there are many fine  patriotic Democrats in this country who are beginning to recognize that the present leadership of their party and the leadership in recent years has strayed far from the principles that once characterized the Democratic Party in the days of Jefferson and Jackson.
nonapplause The hydroelectric capacity of these plants have resulted in a one-third increase over the 1953 level  and new projects either under way or under active consideration will more than double this capacity.
nonapplause Speak  sir
nonapplause Now  I've never looked on Yasser Arafat quite in that light.
nonapplause The second thing I want to say is  we're in a huge debate in Washington over education standards.
nonapplause So  let us go forth with good cheer and stout hearts -- happy warriors out to seize back a country and a world to freedom.
nonapplause So it doesn't always have to be a mother or a grandmother.
nonapplause And by large margins  Americans say they want government to address our great national problems.
nonapplause Now  I want to make a couple of other points.
nonapplause Why do I say that?
nonapplause I never will forget once in 1984 I was running for reelection as governor.
nonapplause Tell them it's not right for you to need something you can't have  so you get sick  but then when you show up at the emergency room  it gets paid for.
nonapplause And that's one of the ways that we're going to make this economy in the 21st century what it was in the 20th century -- an unparalleled force for opportunity and prosperity for all our people.
nonapplause Now  you're the most valuable resource we have  and you're the ones who can save our future.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President and the First Lady at the Kennedy Center Honors Reception
nonapplause The vast Pacific has become smaller  but the future of those who live around it is larger than ever before.
nonapplause "Remember " he said  "our words of admiration are but as sounding brass and tinkling symbols if we do not... prepare to emulate their deeds."
nonapplause And then organize the market so that smaller businesses and self-employed people  a  get discounts if they need it and  b  are able to buy good insurance on the same terms that those of us who are insured by government or larger businesses can.
nonapplause And I come here tonight to tell you that I believe we are living through the period of most profound change in the way we live and work as Americans that we have experienced in 100 years.
nonapplause Since I became President  I have worked on a coordinated economic strategy designed to give you a chance to do well -- by opening more markets to exports  because exportrelated jobs pay 22 percent more on average than jobs that have no connection to the global economy by trying to improve the economic climate in this country  bringing interest rates down and increasing investment  by bringing our deficit down.
nonapplause I took them to the Berlin Wall.
nonapplause He said he was born in a place where the sun shines brightest  and drowns in tears; where Santa Claus has not the visa to enter  and dreams cannot escape their prison of non-existence; where hopes are shattered  and religion is an endangered species; where freedom is in shackles.
nonapplause He was not permitted to go there  none of them had been there—it was for us.
nonapplause Talking to me about why they wanted to come here doesn't explain why our law enforcement and our policies and our national security and defense along that border have failed.
nonapplause And  as he is supposed to have said -- and you won't believe this -- but no bureaucrat ever got involved in it.
nonapplause Therefore  having economic opportunity in the areas where the Palestinians are concentrated  where the authority is now in control of their people  is  I think  critical to buying the time necessary to allow the conditions to mature to make peace possible.
nonapplause I watched your panel last night  and I thought -- the moment of levity on the panel was when Al Shanker was asked  when I was teaching school and I would give students homework  they said "does it count?"
nonapplause I appreciate the work he's done in transportation.
nonapplause And we're free because we're united.
nonapplause It was for them  as it is for us  difficult  in the dead of winter  to sometimes see spring coming.
nonapplause The end of the Cold War has left a world of change in its wake.
nonapplause The story said that "workers were wielding weed whackers  trimming the ivy beds  and planting fresh flowers and holly trees on the grounds of the three-story Tudor Revival home."
nonapplause I went to the Auto Show in Detroit the other day  and one thing I'm looking forward to -- I love this job and I'm not looking forward to two years from now being barred from being President by the Constitution's two-term limit -- but one thing I am looking forward to  now that I've been to the Detroit Auto Show is getting back in those cars  because the cars of the future are going to be environmentally sound and hilariously fun to drive  and safer.
nonapplause They do it through what they call the power of "judicial review."
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy
nonapplause Those were the cathedrals that were instrumental in shaping European history.
nonapplause But this is not a battle over Afghanistan.
nonapplause So the President made the decision that we also had to go on offense  that it wasn't enough for us just to defend America  sort of a "Fortress America" concept  that  in fact  we had to aggressively go after the terrorists wherever they might reside  wherever they were planning to train  to organize -- that that had to be top priority.
nonapplause Tens of thousands go to school carrying not just their lunches  but knives or guns.
nonapplause Because I  at least  look back on a career now of a couple of decades and more of active involvement in conservative causes and public life in a relatively prominent way  and I say to myself  are we just going to allow folks to march in  steal the label  define it any way they please  and march off again  as if nobody has done the work  nobody has struggled in the effort  nobody has spent their days in the wilderness to reach the point where the American people understand that the conservative alternative is the right alternative  but are now faced with a whole range of choices that amount to lying about what that alternative means?
nonapplause It's a part of real life.
nonapplause That is the great question of this time.
nonapplause Now  you know  in Washington  Pete's been named "Watchdog of the Treasury" -- five times he's been named that.
nonapplause Abroad  we seek to lift whole nations by spreading freedom.
nonapplause Instead of losing thousands of lives  we might lose tens of thousands  or even hundreds of thousands of lives in a single day of war.
nonapplause Well  you know  the United States is more secure than we were 4 years ago.
nonapplause And I am so proud to be able to say that during these last 4 years  not 1 inch of territory has been lost to Communist aggression.
nonapplause And after it happens  the motives of those who continue the violence will be clearer to all than they are today.
nonapplause So  I raise them with three legs."
nonapplause But quality comes first.
nonapplause There could be no more eloquent testimony to the character of our country than those words from a war veteran.
nonapplause It's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
nonapplause It is worth celebrating for what it does  for the indirect benefits it will have for people who are not covered by it  but whose employers will be able to get this kind of group insurance  and for what it says about our values and what we can do in the future.
nonapplause If you keep interest rates down  the average family is already saving a couple thousand dollars on home mortgages because we've kept interest rates lower by getting rid of this deficit.
nonapplause This legislation puts the private market to work in supplying rental housing by enabling the government to help needy families with vouchers so they can afford to rent housing of their own choosing.
nonapplause I asked the president a moment ago about that  and he said they've gone up 10 percent a year the last years.
nonapplause And he went on to describe the inordinate pressures our great medical schools are facing  keeping their patients and paying for their care  and having enough money to train doctors and continue to make progress -- because medical schools used to be able to pass along the cost of operations to people who would pay it.
nonapplause The Senate has passed it.
nonapplause And last year  tax revenues grew by $274 billion -- an increase of nearly 15 percent over the previous year.
nonapplause One reason is  they have hundreds and hundreds of retired people who work in these citizens groups with the police not only to catch criminals  but to keep crime from happening in the first place  watching out for the little kids on the street  watching out for their neighbors.
nonapplause I like the idea of you being able to have an asset base that the Congress can't take away.
nonapplause Yes!
nonapplause At the time  as I remember  I was running fifth in New Hampshire in the polls.
nonapplause They may be on the opposite side.
nonapplause It's wonderful to be in Independence  and I'm especially pleased to be here for the 13th annual Santa-Cali-Gon Days celebration.
nonapplause This has been a very moving ceremony.
nonapplause And mark my words; a lot of these new democracies will fall if we had 100 million instead of 40 million AIDS cases.
nonapplause There was a fellow that was on his way to a mountain resort  and a policeman stopped him and said  "Did you know you're driving without taillights?"
nonapplause And as the leader of the nation  he offered a program to restart the engine and return America to the path of steady growth and job creation.
nonapplause It used to be when people went on unemployment they needed a little money to get by on until the economy picked up again and they were called back to their old jobs.
nonapplause And because of you  I was able to make some other friends and see some other people and learn some things about this country of ours.
nonapplause If someone had told you five years ago that Japan would have five years of 1 percent growth a year during which time the stock market there would lose half its value  would you have believed that?
nonapplause In fact  they would repeal many of the Bush tax cuts within their first 100 days in office.
nonapplause He's shown a special commitment to women's health  particularly through his co-sponsorship of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Authorization Act.
nonapplause That wasn't written by a quiet capitalist who'd escaped from Czechoslovakia.
nonapplause But those concepts that worked when we were talking about the Soviets and the Cold War have no meaning whatsoever when you try to apply them to al Qaeda.
nonapplause By giving the Coast Guard new resources  we are supporting the men and women who defend us all.
nonapplause Secretary Rubin has seen the Treasury and the global economy as a whole through enormously challenging times with a steady hand.
nonapplause But I'm especially pleased to be here  as I have been in several other places  to encourage those who are coming together now to highlight the participation of black Americans in this sacred cause--a cause which I think is especially suitable  appropriate  and fitting for black Americans because of the heritage we represent.
nonapplause What does it mean to a single mom's life when she goes to the mailbox in the morning and sees a bank statement instead of a welfare check?
nonapplause Win  Pat  win!
nonapplause Why?
nonapplause I will tell you what I believe it is from travels around this country and from over the State of Iowa.
nonapplause They're cute.
nonapplause But now millions of us have to put up walls to keep our people out.
nonapplause In other words  we cannot have a farm program which  in getting rid of the surpluses  does it by bankrupting America's farmers.
nonapplause He said  "I don't consider myself a hero -- anybody in combat would do the same thing for their buddies and friends.
nonapplause Finally  we must seize the vast potential of tourism right here in Pine Ridge by building a Lakota Sioux heritage cultural center.
nonapplause You know  because of our young men and women in uniform  things have really changed around the world.
nonapplause And if after what I have said you believe that the leadership that Henry Cabot Lodge and I can provide is the leadership that's best for America  if you believe that the leadership that Jack Miller and Charlie Hoeven can provide is the best that you can have in the Senate and the House of Representatives  if you believe that the leadership that Norman Erbe and his colleagues for State government is the best that Iowa can provide  then I say  "Go to work.
nonapplause We are white and black  Asian and Hispanic  Christian and Jew and Muslim  Italian and Vietnamese and Polish Americans and goodness knows how many more today.
nonapplause That's why this campaign can't only be about me.
nonapplause I think that this State is going to go Democratic in November.
nonapplause Yet  time and again  we've let partisan and petty bickering stand in the way of progress.
nonapplause It matters.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President and Vice President at the Opening Session of the Jobs and Economic Growth Forum
nonapplause Wars are won by taking the fight to the enemy.
nonapplause This is a big deal here.
nonapplause We begin to see ourselves in one another.
nonapplause And that's the way I feel about America  too.
nonapplause When Congress voted to authorize force against Saddam Hussein  Senator Kerry voted yes.
nonapplause He had fought the illusions that led to war  pleaded with his countrymen to recognize and arm against this expanding totalitarian war machine  pleaded with his countrymen to be strong and to have courage -- not because he wanted war  but because this was the only way to preserve peace.
nonapplause Senator Kerry  you'll remember  voted in favor of using force against Saddam Hussein  but then during the Democratic primaries when it came to vote for funds that would provide our fighting men and women with body armor  ammunition  jet fuel  and spare parts Senator Kerry voted no.
nonapplause Of all the advanced economies in the world  the percentage of our wealth that goes to taxes at the state  national and local level is lower than every other one except Japan -- we're about even with Japan.
nonapplause We need it.
nonapplause President Bush was pleased to sign the legislation authorizing the John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail.
nonapplause This may come as a great shock to all of you.
nonapplause For one week from today  the House of Representatives will decide whether or not to keep America's exports growing with its vote on fast track.
nonapplause Are we ready  in the name of all this promised materialism  to surrender that understanding of justice?
nonapplause If a career in politics teaches one truth it teaches this: Over the long run it's the people who know  who understand  and who decide.
nonapplause With his legendary grasp of policy and the art of practical government  his long experience  his stamina and his steady judgment  he will be a vital  full member of our economic team.
nonapplause The other one says  they are?
nonapplause And let me say -- you know  before we had to stop them for the election season of the other party --   -- they've got a -- they have to hold their elections; I'm not complaining.
nonapplause He's a sub-chapter S. He's expanding his business.
nonapplause Back in 1990  they faced a top rate of 28 percent.
nonapplause The United States will continue negotiating for significant  verifiable reductions in nuclear armaments  in Geneva and beyond.
nonapplause And the House and the Senate  with bipartisan support  responded with historic pro-growth legislation.
nonapplause Anyway  here's something my mother said about her work  which would apply to all of you and those whom you represent.
nonapplause They wanted to remove a 30-year guarantee of health care to poor families  to older people in nursing homes  to families who have members with disabilities.
nonapplause The Central Europe cannot be the gray zone in a security void  a nowhere land where anything can happen.
nonapplause And this new century faced with immense challenges and bold new goals  President Kennedy's words are equally appropriate and applicable to you.
nonapplause And I want to work out everything in advance including the arrangements for my funeral  my funeral service.
nonapplause We saw it here in New York City  where firefighters and policemen rushed into buildings to save others.
nonapplause So I thought we ought to put it back in  plus the interest savings  and that would have taken Social Security out to 2053  beyond the life of all but the most fortunate baby-boomers.
nonapplause And we've got to try to figure out how we're going to deal with the outstanding issues we've got.
nonapplause They were built by our forebears through silent tears and weary years.
nonapplause I don't think that anyone here would doubt that.
nonapplause I want Mr. Khrushchev  who spoke about colonialism in the United Nations  and about what has happened in Africa  I want him to look not only at Africa  but also at Eastern Europe.
nonapplause I'm delighted to have the -- delighted to have the opportunity this morning to meet with President Basescu of Romania.
nonapplause You've heard the things that are wrong  as well as hearing some of us declare those things that are right.
nonapplause I still don't do it all the time  and every time I don't  I'm sorry.
nonapplause Or Northern Ireland  where the Catholics and the Protestants still fight over what happened 600 years ago?
nonapplause With the tools and incentives to do the job  America's working men and women are every bit as dedicated  skilled  and productive as their German and Japanese counterparts.
nonapplause And to be strong you need stronger families  better schools  safer streets  more jobs  a safer and more prosperous world.
nonapplause And I thank you for letting me be here to help you honor the man who started it all  Christopher Columbus.
nonapplause May I just mention one or two:
nonapplause The statistics speak for themselves.
nonapplause Well that sure clears things up.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the Vice President at the Hudson Institute's James H. Doolittle Award Luncheon Honoring Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
nonapplause I want to thank my partner  Mack McLarty  and all those who have worked under the President's direction to help our nation ensure that these games are a spectacular success for America and for the world.
nonapplause .
nonapplause So anybody who favors repeal is welcome to come talk to these people and tell them why we should go back to the status quo prior to us signing this bill  go back to the way things were.
nonapplause I also -- you can tell these are my friends because they cheered about the pint.
nonapplause About the relationship between what happens around the world and what happens here in America.
nonapplause But if you look at the struggles that they went through and the beatings they took  and you look at what I've been through last year  and what I'm facing this year in Congress just to do the work I got hired to do  never mind the side shows -- it's like old Yogi Berra saying  it's deja vu all over again.
nonapplause ﻿  Vice President's Remarks at a Bush-Cheney '04 Rally
nonapplause I've got to tell you  I'd read the reviews and everything  and I thought that it might be worth seeing.
nonapplause Forty-five years ago  my parents  my brother Othar  my sister Gayle and I came to the shores of this great nation.
nonapplause That's what I couldn't help thinking about when those kids were up here singing tonight.
nonapplause But I've got news for him.
nonapplause Thank you  sir  for your kind words.
nonapplause When they -- they'll make it easier for small businesses to invest in their businesses  to hire more people  and they will be eligible for more tax relief  and we made it easier for people who work for small businesses to take our retirement plans and to keep them when they change jobs  and so many people change jobs today that's very important.
nonapplause We can do better.
nonapplause If politics is corrupt and without integrity  then you are saying it is a business corrupt and without integrity to be a citizen.
nonapplause In this hemisphere  our trade agenda is moving forward on several tracks.
nonapplause No one believes we have the best system of kindergarten through 12th grade education in the world.
nonapplause But immigration is good for the United States  and always has been.
nonapplause And you're right.
nonapplause As they say down at Cape Canaveral  we have liftoff.
nonapplause Our opponents have a very different vision for our country.
nonapplause The CDC  Center for Disease Control  the FBI  working closely with local agencies to respond quickly.
nonapplause So that freedom and opportunity might be passed on forever in this country.
nonapplause It's not a trust.
nonapplause He described it as the number one threat to his country's security  its people its democracy.
nonapplause Your heard Al From say that basically our lodestars have always been in the United States the concept of opportunity  responsibility and community.
nonapplause That's what our Founders told us to do.
nonapplause And if you speak that word in time  you will save them from the pit  you will turn them toward the light  you will set with your word an example  a path before them  that will change their lives.
nonapplause We believe in freedom and the movement of people back and forth across international borders  and our economy depends on having a wide open system  and that's one of the great benefits of being Americans  but it also means we're vulnerable.
nonapplause What's going to happen in the '96 elections?
nonapplause Only 12 members of the United States Senate opposed the funding that would provide vital resources for the troops.

nonapplause When I think if Rainbow/PUSH  I think of two things: Rainbow means we're all in it together  and we all have a place at the table; PUSH is what Jesse does to me when he thinks I'm not doing right.

nonapplause And that's not safe.
nonapplause And what is your role and responsibility  whether you're in public life or you're a private citizen?
nonapplause Many older citizens are frightened to go out even during the daytime.
nonapplause And that means trying to get as much done as we can this year to take advantage of our prosperity  to take advantage of our confidence  and not to simply relax and enjoy it.

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President to Bush-Cheney 2004 Luncheon

nonapplause I was always looking for things I could do.
nonapplause And all this work we're doing to bring our kids into the modern age is not possible.
nonapplause So they withdrew it.
nonapplause And we were flooded with all these -- I mean little towns  200 people  300 people  500 people  you know -- asking for this money  because they had nothing to do for their children.
nonapplause And we want that for our youngsters; and we want their world to be a world of peace  but a world of peace with freedom.

nonapplause We are honored to be here.
nonapplause Thirty months ago  I set out to change the economic direction of our country  to bring the economy of America back and to help the economy of California recover.

nonapplause Together  through the Marshall Plan  we rebuilt Europe and made perhaps the greatest investment in human history.
nonapplause I have to tell you a little experience I had that sort of fits what I've seen happen to the party that Jim and I once belonged to and why I know that there must be some Democrats here -- because I've met them all across the country -- who know that they're out of step with the leadership.
nonapplause In other words  it is obvious that you can have a smaller government but a more progressive one that gives you a more stronger America.

nonapplause It's important to remember  when someone says that the administration is planning to cut the budget  what we really mean is we're planning to cut the growth in the fiscal year '82 budget from 16 percent to 7 percent.
nonapplause And what these figures mean is that now we are drawing the line on the deficit down to $200 billion.

nonapplause There are only 17 months left in this administration.
nonapplause But here's the thing -- and I'm talking specifically to the young people who are here today -- in the end  we can start all kinds of mentoring programs and give you guys all the mentors in the world  but it won't make much of a difference unless you do your parts as well.
nonapplause We had to coordinate all the details with 18 NATO allies.
nonapplause And I believe as strongly as I can say  that that's one of the reasons that makes this campaign for health care reform so important; that it will give our people the security to change.
nonapplause The rescissions would deprive 15 000 of the opportunity to serve in AmeriCorps  100 000 educationally disadvantaged students would lose their special services.

nonapplause No one I knew believed either thing.
nonapplause And I said  "Well  you had a queen once named Victoria who did rather well."
nonapplause As a matter of fact  it's hard enough to save even if you're well-off.

nonapplause Well  thank you very much for that warm welcome.

nonapplause We are talking about whether with the spread of the word of our Lord  we can help to save the hearts and the spirits and the souls of the mothers and young men and women who may be involved in this terrible temptation of abortion  but we are also talking about whether we can save our nation's conscience and save our people's soul and save that creed without which we shall not survive in freedom.

nonapplause In 1954  in Topeka  there were 18 neighborhood schools for white children and just four black-only elementary schools.
nonapplause And we began the welfare reform effort through the Executive Branch  as Howard Dean said; then I vetoed two bills first because I refused to take away the guarantee of health care and nutrition from children  and I wanted to have enough money for child care if we were going to require people to go to work.
nonapplause Do you know that there are a lot of kids who live in communities that don't have access to a grocery store or a farmers market or a place to buy fruits and vegetables?
nonapplause But I'm afraid this discussion will now have to wait for another occasion  for it's been overtaken by events of an international nature  events that I feel compelled as President to comment on today.
nonapplause We will continue our concerted efforts to help fulfill the aspirations of your people and retrieve their legitimate rights.

nonapplause Now  some other members of Congress are proposing a tax deduction to help subsidize the cost of private Medigap insurance.

nonapplause But in the 1980s when the global economy got really tough and the screws were tightened on company after company after company  a lot of people said  "Okay  we'll move down there."
nonapplause Of course we spend less than one percent  and we're dead last among all the advanced economies of the world in what we spend on foreign assistance.
nonapplause Well  1996 came around.

nonapplause And just this decade  with no living memory of democracy or freedom to guide them  they have built a country more open to the world than ever; a country with a free press and a robust  even raucous debate; a country that should see in the first year of the new millennium the first peaceful democratic transfer of power in its 1 000-year history.
nonapplause You know  one of the most common phrases in our vernacular is  "oh  what I did was nothing  it's just a drop in the ocean."
nonapplause The new right that was produced in a sense as a sort of counter-revolution to that  in the '80s  thought the solution to everything was just get rid of government  just get it out -- as little of it as possible  get rid of it all  economics of laissez faire and socially  often I think indifferent to what was actually breaking apart the bonds of society.
nonapplause It means that in principle  when they let us keep any  they are doin' us a favor.
nonapplause And in a truly bipartisan way  we will preserve the salvation of this country.
nonapplause This approach deprives you of the necessary resources to return Federal dollars to places where they're really needed.

nonapplause That's a difficult task.
nonapplause You know  when you go to your Sunday school or your synagogue or mosque  and vow to help somebody in need  you're really helping define the face of America.

nonapplause The number of young people taking core courses has jumped from 13 percent in '82  to 52 percent in '94.
nonapplause Now  in a crowd like this  I know there must be a number of Democrats and -- --
nonapplause Because a family-destroying approach to education has turned our children over to the NEA  and Planned Parenthood  and others who are leading to a result that I found in New Hampshire the other day.
nonapplause And I don't mean  I don't mean -- well  you know  it is a big word.
nonapplause Everything you do will be a huge help to the President's campaign.

nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause I constantly say to the audience which I sometimes address of businessmen: "There are not many people in Governments who know how to run business and if they did they would be out there doing it".
nonapplause We must pursue vigorously research on defensive technologies that can permit us to intercept strategic ballistic missiles -- fired deliberately or accidentally -- before they reach our own soil or that of our allies.

nonapplause See  producing a constitution is a difficult process.
nonapplause This is not politics.
nonapplause Well  I can tell you  having done some work during the course of my career in the State Department as a consular officer--the folks who sit abroad in our various consulates and issue the visas  and so forth--I can tell you that if we put a "y'all come" sign on America  don't kid yourself  everybody would come.

nonapplause And it's important to me that -- we know the Republicans will always have more money than we do.

nonapplause As many of the scholars here have argued  and doubtless will argue with greater clarity than I can  the Progressive legacy is not primarily a set of programs that no longer have great relevance to us  but a vital set of principles: the idea that new conditions demand a new approach to government.
nonapplause Find out if there's a connection.'

nonapplause It is very hard  I think  for us to accept the proposition that this man has demonstrated consistently over time the qualities  I think  we need in a Commander-in-Chief given the nature of the threat we face  and given what is going to be required in the years ahead to keep America safe and defeat our enemies and guarantee the safety and security of our kids and grandkids  and that ultimately is the test.

nonapplause She hosted me for my first visits.
nonapplause We must also effect a change in the way we organize our schools and run our classrooms.
nonapplause Now  I want to say a little more about Chicago's reforms in a moment  but it was because of that that I made a proposal to Congress  which did not pass last time  but I think we still have to keep working on this  because if you want these schools to work right  they don't have to be modern  they can be old buildings  but the windows don't need to be broken  and the kids don't need to be in danger.

nonapplause It's a budget that prioritizes education.
nonapplause And I say that to make this point: We cannot pretend  if we have a truly progressive vision of the future  that we can ever achieve what we want to achieve unless we hold our children -- all of our children -- without regard to their race  their income or their background  to high standards of learning  and then give them the support they need to meet those standards  and measure whether they do or not  and if they don't  keep on working at it until they do.

nonapplause We're trying to bring an industry here to the United States.
nonapplause As you can hear  I'm a little hoarse.
nonapplause The folks in this room  you're the ones that made those phone calls  right?

nonapplause The way it works today is the government gives you a rule book  and if you can't jump over in the prescribed way you just never get over the bar.

nonapplause That kind of wisdom is characteristic of my friend Al  and it's characteristic of the people of Wyoming.

nonapplause Our failure to secure our border has become an issue of life and death  for people who are dying because of the false allure that is created by that neglect  and of a nation whose identity is threatened because we are allowing our commitment to who we are and what we should be for the world to be diluted  by our neglect of this vital prerequisite of our life in common.
nonapplause I would work hard to try to change the tone in Washington  D.C.  to get rid of all the bitterness and all the ugliness and finger pointing and name calling.

nonapplause One is on the stimulus package  on the Recovery Act.
nonapplause Wyoming  of course  is unique in the sense that we only had one congressman.
nonapplause We will rebuild.
nonapplause I remember also your historic address in another ancient hall in London almost exactly six years later—your report on your Summit Meeting in Moscow was an inspiration to all who heard it  but more than that  you gave us that day your own declaration of faith in the principles which have inspired your political life and your words illumined the centuries of histories residing in Guildhall's ancient stones; and I remember vividly the feeling of sheer joy at your election eight years ago  knowing that we thought so much alike  believed in so many of the same things and convinced that together we could get our countries back on their feet  restore their values and create a safer and  yes  a better world.
nonapplause This is also -- the moisture also comes  according to the scientists  much more now in the big one-time storm events  so it doesn't recharge the aquifers and the springs  it just rushes off.

nonapplause While there are many local education authorities and many excellent schools  there are I regret too many schools with low academic standards  indifferent teaching and inadequate discipline.
nonapplause And I can promise all those who love freedom and whose hearts must be with those freedom fighters who struggle for their national survival that the Soviet troops must leave Afghanistan and the United States will never agree to any steps that would put the freedom fighters and Afghan hopes for self-determination at risk.
nonapplause So too  our ally the Republic of Korea is an essential partner for security and well-being in the region  and is also becoming a global partner.
nonapplause When I was President and we had all that good economic growth  about 30% of our new jobs came from the expansion of trade  and those jobs paid on average 30% more than comparable jobs in non-trade-affiliated enterprises.
nonapplause I think of them  too  because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries.
nonapplause If we cross this threshold  will we ever return?
nonapplause Are we going to have a higher level of citizenship and a higher level of society  or are we going to be thrown to the winds of chaos and anarchy by having global marketplace dominate democratic institutions and people?
nonapplause And I have been just struck  time and time again  by the heroic stories that they tell.
nonapplause In my Foundation  we basically work on things that would advance the Millennium development goals: bringing economic opportunity to poor people at home and around the world; fighting AIDS around the world; promoting religious and racial reconciliation in Northern Ireland  the Middle East  the Balkans  other places where I work; advancing the education and citizen service.
nonapplause He gathered others of his type across the South.
nonapplause You know  this thing of partisan politics  right now I'm reminded of a story.
nonapplause You know  my generation -- and then there are a few generations between mine and yours --   -- but most of us grew up in a land where we took it for granted that we could dream the highest and finest of dreams  and if we were willing to try and work  we could make them come true  that there was no ceiling  no limit on what we could accomplish or how high we could fly by our own strength and ability.
nonapplause Can I come to your place -- I think the President has in mind a particular stop.
nonapplause Yet in Chile  they're trying to move something into Chile for that economy.
nonapplause But let the world understand: Our purpose is not belligerency  but respect; not conflict  but deterrence; and not war  but peace.
nonapplause We think that's an important concept  as well  too  and fairer  long-term  to a majority of Americans than the way the system works today.
nonapplause Along the way  Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities  and extending the circle of citizenship  opportunity and dignity to women.

nonapplause Six years ago last Friday -- I can hardly believe it  but it was six years ago last Friday that I announced my intention to run for President -- challenging America to embrace and to vigorously pursue a vision of our country for the 21st century: to make the American Dream alive for every person responsible to work for it  to keep our country the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity  to bring our people together across all the lines that divide us into one America.
nonapplause But no sector of the economy can be totally isolated from the health of the overall society.
nonapplause That's the only thing that produces more jobs and genuine jobs  and if we are to have the bigger companies of tomorrow  we must start the smaller businesses of today.
nonapplause The world is becoming more interdependent  which simply means for good or ill  we can't escape each other.
nonapplause Let me tell you what's going on in Washington.

nonapplause Ray Chambers you've heard about.
nonapplause Pei  or the plays of David Wong  who is with us today  and who reminds us that American art  in many ways  is the art of the rest of the world.

nonapplause It will break him.” So those weren't very hopeful signs.
nonapplause We've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find savings just like this in every corner of this budget  because with the deficit we inherited  the cost of the recession we face  and the long-term challenges we have to meet  it's never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers  we do what it takes to cut this deficit in half by the end of my first term in office.
nonapplause But I might be wrong.
nonapplause But keep in mind that  from the start  my belief was -- and this is shared with our ISAF allies  that our military strategy is only part of a broader project that has to include a civilian component  has to include a diplomatic component  and all those different factors are being weighed and considered at this point.
nonapplause Casting his mind's eye over the parade of young faces down through the years  Professor Blum said  and I quote  "I don't have the foggiest recollection of him."

nonapplause And I only hope that it is as enjoyable to you as it is to me every day.
nonapplause Remembering what we saw on the morning of 9/11  and knowing the nature of our enemies  we have as clear a responsibility as could ever fall to government: We must do everything in our power to protect the American people from terrorist attack  and to keep terrorists from ever acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
nonapplause For about the last 15 or 20 years  half of us have been stuck so that our country is growing  but we are growing apart even within the middle class.
nonapplause Dr. Jewell Plummer Cobb is president of California State University at Fullerton.
nonapplause And there's one way to make sure we won't: George Bush is going to America with his own proposition number one -- no new taxes.
nonapplause But since then  because of this experience with Will Power To Youth building sets  Jesus is now working in Home Depot and was just named "Home Depot Employee of the Month."
nonapplause This is a sea change in the reality that existed just a few years ago.
nonapplause In many areas -- abortion  crime  pornography  and others -- progress will take place when the Federal judiciary is made up of judges who believe in law and order and a strict interpretation of the Constitution.
nonapplause And if we all work together  we can face these terrible new threats to our security successfully.
nonapplause And  of course  in addition to the benefits for the American consumer  the project also holds the promise of an extremely attractive and competitive automobile for world markets at the turn of the century and the thriving U.S. auto industry to produce them.

nonapplause And so I ask you  as we go through the last difficult and exhilarating challenges of this year  as you head into the political season next year  keep in your mind -- especially those of you in this Congressional Black Caucus -- the enormous potential you have to reach the heart and soul of America  to remind them that we must be one.

nonapplause Well  thank you.
nonapplause Well  first  I know some people get nervous about investments.
nonapplause You know  for some time  over the last several weeks at least  he was talking about a new Reagan and an old Reagan.
nonapplause Abroad we will oppose threats to our freedom and security wherever they gather.
nonapplause And this election cannot be won by sound bites.
nonapplause This President is unequalled in his devotion to promoting science and technology as the engine of our economy and as a means to improving our quality of life.
nonapplause My mother  a working woman.
nonapplause But I think they've got ideas that would not be good for working families  and I don't think they have an accurate view of what this country is like and what it needs.
nonapplause It means that the children in this room will grow up into an economy that is much stronger than it otherwise would have been.
nonapplause At the same time  as has been acknowledged today  that you are here  filled with mixed emotions; so am I.
nonapplause We're protecting the health of our families and communities.
nonapplause Most of you have friends in other states  where the outcome of the election is not yet clear.
nonapplause I get a few comments made about me.
nonapplause The economic approach the president's recommended does several things.
nonapplause And I know that a lot of folks are cynical about whether change is possible.
nonapplause So some years ago  we indexed those retirements so that we make an annual adjustment to your Social Security check that accounts for whatever inflation has occurred over the prior year.
nonapplause But I wouldn't stop there.
nonapplause Now  let me just mention one final issue.
nonapplause We've created jobs for 13 consecutive months -?
nonapplause We're just asking him to do what millions of American families have been forced to do when their economic realities have been changed so dramatically in the last couple of years.
nonapplause The legislation passed overwhelmingly  with a vote in the Senate of 87 to 12  and that small group of 12 senators voting no included Senators Kerry and Edwards.
nonapplause Getting up every day  slaving away  trying to take care of people  have children without insurance  caring for people who come into their office who are on public assistance who have children with insurance because of the Medicaid program.
nonapplause Yet the threat from Soviet forces  conventional and strategic  from the Soviet drive for domination  from the increase in espionage and state terror remains great.
nonapplause The Massachusetts mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the day.
nonapplause And that's kept interest rates down and that's permitted this economy to grow.
nonapplause Yes  all of you are leaders.
nonapplause I think it's an obligation we owe our children.
nonapplause Yesterday  I was down at the University of Alabama  and the architecture there is beautiful  with all the charm of the Old South.
nonapplause I say  amen.
nonapplause But our friendship is strong  and our alliance endures.
nonapplause We will go the extra mile.
nonapplause Somebody had a sign up.
nonapplause Things took a while to get going  but pretty soon folks from all over the country were doing what many of you do.
nonapplause Now  I don't deserve any special credit for casting that vote because after a morning session in the Oval Office  I went to the Hill with some specific instructions that day from the President of the United States.
nonapplause And thank you for witnessing the signing of this executive order.
nonapplause Sick societies don't produce dedicated police officers like Tom Delahanty or able and devoted public servants like Jim Brady.
nonapplause And we can answer those challenges with practical  sensible  compassionate reforms.
nonapplause These retailers would need to restock their shelves  and that creates business for manufacturers.
nonapplause We are profoundly grateful as Americans for this remarkable family.
nonapplause Thanks to each and every one of you for your support for Mike Whalen and Jim Nussle.
nonapplause We looked down the road and tried to identify something that might adversely affect our nation and lead to significant economic difficulties.
nonapplause The people of the SBA play a role in expanding our ownership society by opening the door of opportunity to millions of Americans through training  through counseling  through access to capital  through access to federal contracts  through advocacy.
nonapplause And I don't know if you hear that enough  but it's real.
nonapplause And we need to build new partnerships across regions and religions -- and that requires religious leaders  and NGOs  citizens to help build the good governance  and transparent institutions and basic services upon which true security depends.
nonapplause The budget for the Department of Health and Human Services  roughly $250 billion  became the third largest budget in the world.
nonapplause We will be judged  20  30  50 years from now by whether we use this historic opportunity to think of the twilight years of America  to think of the morning years of America  to think of how we can bring our country together.
nonapplause You know  they sent out Social Security checks on time.
nonapplause But now their main mission in life seems to be to stop any kind of collective action that will help us to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
nonapplause The time has come to join together to save that system for our children and our grandchildren.
nonapplause It's been tried and found unfair  unworkable  and unproductive.
nonapplause But that's not reality.
nonapplause We've come a long way  but much remains for us to do.
nonapplause That's what our campaigns were about.
nonapplause On issue after issue -- from national security  to agriculture  to economic growth -- President Bush has led the way in making progress for the American people.
nonapplause We welcome the fact  Mrs Thatcher  that such subjects as terrorism  drugs and the spread of AIDS were discussed at the European Council meeting.
nonapplause You'd think that would be a nonpartisan issue.
nonapplause In the broader Middle East  we are encouraging free markets  democracy  and tolerance -- because these are the ideas and the aspirations that overcome violence  and turn societies to the pursuit of peace.
nonapplause We need to make it a priority to cut taxes for working families and the middle class  not just to pay for college and job training  but for health insurance and child care and long-term care.
nonapplause Let me say to all of you  I know that a lot of your assignments are still dangerous.
nonapplause These are the questions that are being asked of you and your generation.
nonapplause For example  that incident where a Yankee from up North was down here driving on one of your highways and found himself in a collision with a car driven by one of the local citizens.
nonapplause And we're doing it because we want to get the long term unemployed back into the world of work.
nonapplause As the ISF gains strength and experience and as the political process advances  we'll be able to decrease troop levels without losing our capacity to defeat the terrorists.
nonapplause Ten years ago I had the honor of recognizing John Johnson for his contributions as a native of our native state  Arkansas.
nonapplause It creates an exchange  a marketplace  where people who don't have health insurance or small businesses that want to get a better deal can pool their purchasing power and then negotiate with insurance companies to drive down costs and drive down premiums -- the same way  by the way  that federal workers and members of Congress  by the way  and people who work for big companies are able to get a better deal because they're part of a bigger pool.
nonapplause And again  there's a certain sense in which this effort on the part of the opposition is embarrassingly old-fashioned and out of date.
nonapplause They are here and they know that there's speculation about a presidential run.
nonapplause It had estimated losses of more than $160 million  just due to waste and fraud.
nonapplause And so part of making sure the environment is hospitable to a capital formation and the entrepreneurial spirit is trade.
nonapplause We're improving care for our wounded warriors  especially those with Post-Traumatic Stress and Traumatic Brain Injury.
nonapplause And that's important for you to hear.
nonapplause In every major city where more police officers have been trained not simply to catch criminals  but to prevent crime  to work with friends and neighbors and help kids on the street  the crime rate has gone down.
nonapplause We cannot be vague about this nation's commitment to its moral principles.
nonapplause This is the future we're going to have.
nonapplause Look  folks  it's great to be home.
nonapplause We know flexible housing vouchers serve needy families better at substantially less taxpayer cost.
nonapplause Let me be clear: I'm committed to making these cuts in a way that protects our senior citizens.
nonapplause You don't have to wait to use plain language in your dealings with consumers.
nonapplause As for paying for reform  Congressman Rob Andrews challenged the group to identify additional ways to pay for reform and suggested that everyone needs to put something on the table to get reform done.
nonapplause We have to create an environment where business can create new jobs and new growth.
nonapplause Our recovery efforts  though  will continue.
nonapplause So on the whole  as you look to the future and we have more and more of these kinds of problems  we'll have to find ways to solve them  usually through cooperative means and therefore we need to think about how to strength these institutions.
nonapplause But we've come together today because of what we share -- a belief that we are all bound together by certain common aspirations.
nonapplause It was clear then that we needed to make difficult and too long deferred choices.
nonapplause Over half of them gave money over the internet.
nonapplause Because we know that we feel more alive and we feel better about ourselves  better about other people and better about life in general when we're feeling and being and reaching big  rather than when we're feeling and being and digging small.
nonapplause There will be more casualties.
nonapplause And if you look at where we have to go in the world  I am telling you  if you -- I don't know how may of you saw the -- I guess a lot of you did -- the coverage of the trip I took to Ireland and to England and then later to Germany to see our troops  and to Madrid to meet with the leaders of Europe  but on the street everywhere  it was amazing the response that people gave  not to me  to the United States of America  because they thought America was still there trying to lead  trying to fulfill a role that only we can fulfill now.
nonapplause Well  generation after generation of hardworking Americans have understood that truth and used it to build the most prosperous nation on Earth.
nonapplause We want to handcuff the big spenders by enacting a line-item veto and a constitutional amendment mandating that government spend no more than government takes in.
nonapplause You know  if my opponent's campaign were a television show it would be  “Let's Make a Deal.”   You get to trade your prosperity for that surprise he's got hidden behind the curtain.
nonapplause They say  well  we want to get higher rates of return and we want to let ordinary people  including poor people paying Social Security  have a chance to create wealth.
nonapplause I believe these figures demonstrate a commitment to civil rights that is firm and far-reaching.
nonapplause Dorothy Height is one of the world's most tireless and accomplished advocates of civil rights  the rights of women and the health and stability of family and community life.
nonapplause Properly used  the global network can increase access to education services  make teachers more effective  improve efficiency.
nonapplause And almost every time  as he came back people said to themselves  how does he do that -- because he has had such great success crisscrossing the globe as a champion of human rights and justice.
nonapplause Thank you  Mari.
nonapplause He even questioned the patriotism of a Senator from his own party when that Senator called the embargo unfair and unworkable.
nonapplause Trade  of course  cannot ensure the survival of new democracies  and we have seen the enduring power of ethnic hatred  the incredible power of ethnic divisions --even among people literate and allegedly understanding -- to splinter democracy and to savage the nation's state.
nonapplause We need to publicize what's in these textbooks  including in some schools in the United States.
nonapplause Yeah  they were exhausted and they were heartbroken.
nonapplause There are contingencies set aside.
nonapplause And they were saying your faith was misplaced and you set your sights to high  and your hope is naïve  and Washington won't change.
nonapplause And they don't ask for that all-out sacrifice from us.
nonapplause Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles  too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford.
nonapplause He has an idea for an independent business  a small business  that he is organizing  to start.
nonapplause His secretary of 21 years  Ora Theard  will accept the medal in his memory.
nonapplause I missed that  too.
nonapplause It may not happen this time  which is one reason the heat  the incoming fire is so intense now  because they know it may not happen this time.
nonapplause They want freedom.
nonapplause In the time that we have I cannot discuss that subject in detail.
nonapplause But all too often  their best efforts are thwarted because the technological revolution that has transformed our society over the past two decades has yet to reach many parts of our government.
nonapplause Your fellow party members here are performing a very necessary bridging function  for the United Kingdom's integration into Europe.
nonapplause Today  this nation that once brought the four corners of the world together is working with its EU allies and America to bring the world together to advance democracy and human rights.
nonapplause Were people trying to slug each other whole time there  or they actually have a good conversation?
nonapplause Well  that doesn't make any sense  because not all the debt retires -- comes due at the end of 10 years.
nonapplause I can tell you one little story here.
nonapplause We know that we still have so much work to do on education.
nonapplause It will not be a policy of blame  but one of responsibility.
nonapplause But this new department allows us to coordinate our defenses in a systematic way -- analyzing threats  guarding our borders and airports  protecting critical infrastructure  and coordinating the response of the nation to any future emergency.
nonapplause So much of what America means and stands for we owe to you -- to your indomitable spirit and generosity and to your impassioned love for liberty and independence.
nonapplause And people run around now with a lot of gloomy faces  some of them  and they're trying to say  "Why isn't this going on?"
nonapplause In this context  we will see the implementation of terror and act as if we are in presence of a legitimate instrument of policy?
nonapplause So many of you have helped us on all these issues.
nonapplause In all of Africa  1 percent or less have finished high school  and yet we expect them to maintain a free society?
nonapplause It's an honor to be sharing the stage with some of America's finest citizens  our firefighters and policemen  EMS teams.
nonapplause The lion jumped on him and said  "Shut up.
nonapplause I made it clear that I wanted to be re-elected  I didn't want to be recycled.
nonapplause We can make a difference when we work together and when we determine to do things.
nonapplause You worked hard.
nonapplause Some say the Soviet Union is reappraising its foreign policy these days to concentrate on internal reform.
nonapplause Or are we going to go ahead?
nonapplause Now I would like to ask the representatives of each of the major geographical regions of the Americas -- the Caribbean  North America  Central America and South America -- to report on the agreements we have forged.
nonapplause With cooperation and consultation  however  we've been able to complement our various approaches.
nonapplause I promise you  a lot of people who will vote on this agreement and carry its fate still do not understand that elemental principle.
nonapplause Today's fourth quarter economic figures underscore the need for Congress to pass the President's jobs and growth plan as soon as possible.
nonapplause We also have some tremendous memories  coming to Arizona during the last two national campaigns.
nonapplause How do we do that?
nonapplause I'd wake up in the morning and my heart was getting a little harder.
nonapplause We're going to let them make the tough choices.
nonapplause I appreciate both of those agencies providing the underpinnings of good capital.
nonapplause It was in midst of a great depression that FDR formed the Civilian Conservation Corps that built the trails and campgrounds and parks we enjoy today.
nonapplause Under President Bush  America acts in the world according to both our fundamental interests and our founding ideals.
nonapplause I would like to talk about them in relationship to the problems we presently confront in this Nation.
nonapplause Ours is an administration that trusts the local people to chart the path to excellence.
nonapplause If you think about the way Social Security works today  let's assume you've got a man and wife working  both of them work  both of them pay into Social Security throughout their careers  and then they get ready to hit retirement age  and one of them dies.
nonapplause President Clinton knows that one of the most important bridges to the future will be built on discoveries in science and advancements in technology.
nonapplause I think it is terribly important.
nonapplause I don't mean to ignore the folks behind us here.
nonapplause Thank you.
nonapplause Representative Henry Gonzalez and Senator Don Riegle have both long been champions of reinvesting in our communities.
nonapplause Fired up?
nonapplause I want to acknowledge the remarkable American and Chinese leaders who will co-chair this effort.
nonapplause Like Ronald Reagan  Henry has never cared much for the idea of term limits.
nonapplause What is the common good of the American people?
nonapplause When critical decisions are made by our people to go forward to turn back  to reach out or turn inward  to unify or divide  to believe or doubt.
nonapplause You know  just the other day Bob Hope was with us  and Bob said that I got my exercise by jogging three times around Tip O'Neill.
nonapplause And in the broader Middle East  we're aiding the rise of democracy  because free nations will not be the breeding grounds of terror.
nonapplause But if I had thought of all of this sooner  I would have had that Marine Band come to play for us today  because we really should have music  because this is not just a solemn proclamation signing.
nonapplause And that's what I think we ought to do.
nonapplause And ultimately we saw victory in the Cold War for free markets and freedom.
nonapplause We've encouraged Europe's newly freed nations from helping citizens groups in the New Independent States to monitor their elections to strengthening the independence of their judicial systems.
nonapplause And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace.
nonapplause Well  this is very important because  unlike the State of California  the Constitution does not give American citizens the opportunity to vote Supreme Court Justices out of office.
nonapplause As we've seen  however  that approach was tried before and proved entirely inadequate to protecting the American people from terrorists who are quite certain they're at war with us.
nonapplause In all of our actions  the world's democracies must send an unmistakable message: that the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction only invites isolation and carries with it great costs.
nonapplause There was just a hushed moment of silence  and then that crowd came to their feet with just about the most heartfelt applause and ovation that anyone has ever heard.
nonapplause It weighs upon a society where unspeakable acts of destruction have occurred.
nonapplause And therefore  she had to ride  leading them in parades and so forth as a princess.
nonapplause I remember when the President -- by the way  never write a memo to the President suggesting that a job be undertaken that you don't want to have.
nonapplause In addition to that  we  in America  forgave all our bilateral debt to these countries as long as they did the following things.
nonapplause Let me just highlight a few of the bill's provisions.
nonapplause We're clearly making progress -- on the economy  on crime  on making the government work for ordinary people -- clearly.
nonapplause Some have been  for one reason or another  introduced.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President at Reception for Senator Boxer and the DNC
nonapplause In this time of testing  our greatest responsibility is the active defense of our nation.
nonapplause And people felt good about it  even when they disagreed about the specifics.
nonapplause Senator Johnson and I are prepared to carry on a great effort to secure a new frontier for the United States  a frontier which offers not merely what we are going to promise in this campaign  but offers an opportunity to all of us to serve the great Republic.
nonapplause The new Mondale thinks higher taxes lead to a healthy economy.
nonapplause And even if I do  I'll just repeat something.
nonapplause And this calls for urgency  not panic.
nonapplause But it ended in victory  and in the birth of new  lasting  and peaceful democracies.
nonapplause He didn't.
nonapplause So we're making good progress.
nonapplause His vision  creativity  scholarship  mentorship and passion have touched the core of what it means not only to be African American  but to be human in a too-rough world.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the First Lady at the International Women of Courage Awards
nonapplause And he's kept his word to the United States military.
nonapplause But we're in a unique position in history now.
nonapplause This has served Mickey well in everything he's ever done.
nonapplause And I think they would all acknowledge they have absolute complete faith and trust in this man.
nonapplause And if the Congress would just act responsibly  we can knock those interest rates down even more.
nonapplause And an official at the U.S. Mission to the U.N. remarked  we were as surprised as anyone when Senator Kerry starting talking about meeting with the Security Council.
nonapplause If we have any hope of bringing success back to these inner cities  we have to have people there who care and who are committed.
nonapplause With respect to our economic program  the well-being of women  like all Americans  depends on a healthy economy.
nonapplause My old friend  James Lee Witt and Bea Gonzalez and the team that completely reorganized FEMA so that all its resources are available to respond to any emergency.
nonapplause We increased by 30 percent -- by 30 percent -- the amount of aid in a tough time.
nonapplause But women aren't just disproportionately affected because of the role we play in our family  we're also affected because the jobs we do are more likely to be part-time or in small businesses  jobs that are -- less likely provide health insurance.
nonapplause We have given the Afghan children something to smile about  because America's children are generous and kind and compassionate.
nonapplause They saw their children killed.
nonapplause All right.
nonapplause They were against it.
nonapplause Okay  let's shake it off  and we're ready to have some fun  have some conversation.
nonapplause They don't go to a record store -- a C.D.
nonapplause Let our message be clear: We are asking the American people to stand with us  steady and unwavering.
nonapplause Speaking for Nancy and myself  I can tell you  from El Paso to Texarkana  from the top of the Panhandle to the mouth of the Rio Grande  and clear through the middle of the great Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex  there's nothing we'd like better than to "Waltz Across Texas With You."
nonapplause That's how it got its authority.
nonapplause You gave crucial support to the President's call for early tax relief.
nonapplause Building a strong economy also means creating strong institutions  and above all  the rule of law.
nonapplause And we agreed to pursue vigorously sustainable development.
nonapplause And what I'd like to do is just take a few minutes to talk about sort of what's happening in the world today and particularly what all of us have been seeing on our television screens for the last few days.
nonapplause We can't make a utopia  but we sure can make it a lot more beautiful.
nonapplause Their economy would be in ruins.
nonapplause Now finally  there are those who say at a time of crisis  we shouldn't be pursuing such a strategy; we've got too many other things to do.
nonapplause That name should be familiar to you -- the man who served the longest as a POW in Vietnam.
nonapplause He is going to be faced with the problem of trying to maintain in the first months of his office full employment in the United States  and in 1961 we may face a difficult time.
nonapplause Yes  we are clear-eyed about the shortfalls of our international system.
nonapplause They hate us  they hate our country  and they hate the liberties for which we stand.
nonapplause First  to protect the rights of individual members against their own union.
nonapplause And let me just mention two other things very briefly.
nonapplause He said something true.
nonapplause We're making progress on energy.
nonapplause They would have come and gotten them and  in my opinion  there would have been a war.
nonapplause We can think of so many things--maybe in our own lives  maybe in the lives of others we know  where people have thought that if they just had enough things  everything would be all right.
nonapplause Because it's so much easier in the world today to identify what we're against instead of what we're for.
nonapplause If we get out and do the job as we did it in this State in 1948 when President Truman carried Illinois by only 17 000 votes and he carried Ohio by 7 000 votes  those are the victories that made it possible for him to resume the leadership of the United States  instead of Thomas Dewey.
nonapplause They want to know that we're trying hard and that we've got their interests in mind.
nonapplause It was all got up by the Press—mere cocktail circuit gossip!
nonapplause It makes me feel so secure to know that our leader has such a love for our country."
nonapplause You know  I think everyone should pay attention to the fact that true as the facts are that Governor Thompson gave you about how my opponent would increase taxes  I think you'd better pay attention to the fact that Chuck Percy's opponent has made it plain that if he was elected  he would strive for twice as much in increased taxes as Mr. Mondale is talking about.
nonapplause Thank you to Carmela and Nancy  thank you for letting me share your story.
nonapplause Three million Americans lost their jobs in the last six months of 2008.
nonapplause So they are struggling -- struggling every day to find affordable childcare; or someone to look after an aging parent  which is becoming more the issue; scrambling to make things work when the usual arrangements fall through.
nonapplause What I'm talking about is the soul  the inspiration of Nevada  the home of great people in the land of the brave and the free.
nonapplause Same reason  in a more -- thank God -- mundane but still very cruel way  people were spitting on and kicking and cursing those nine kids when they tried to go to Little Rock Central High School 42 years ago.
nonapplause America still matters in Bosnia.
nonapplause We've reversed the decline in our military defenses and restored respect for America.
nonapplause But as I told you  I think we've got to anticipate problems  particularly on this issue  because the longer we wait  the more difficult the solutions become.
nonapplause In Mogadishu in 1993  terrorists killed 19 American soldiers  and thereafter  United States forces withdrew from Somalia.
nonapplause That's why today I'm so proud to announce that the Department of Defense  after strong support from a former Senate colleague named Jim Johnson from South Dakota  is dedicating over half a billion dollars from this Recovery Act to extend a program to assist military and Defense Department -- military as well as civilian Defense Department employees who are homeowners when they sell their homes at a loss  which many of you are faced with.
nonapplause I live in the same working class neighborhood in the same house I purchased thirty five years ago.
nonapplause We are here with one Andrew Biggs  a fine lad  as you can see.
nonapplause I won't bother to recite here all the statistics about how the inflation  interest rates  and unemployment have come down  or the many indicators that demonstrate America's current economic expansion  because the real question you and I must now ask ourselves is how can we solidify the gains we've made and ensure that the prosperity we're now enjoying will endure not just for the rest of this decade  but on into the next century.
nonapplause And let me say this: If we must ever ask our military personnel to put their lives on the line for us  we're not going to give them anything less than the top-quality equipment they need to get the job done.
nonapplause What I want to say to you is that there will be an attempt in this election to blur the distinctions between the parties in the hope that the traditional advantage that our friends in the Republican Party have enjoyed among large voting blocks around the country will be there and that they will basically make people sort of feel like it's okay if they win  things are going so well and there are no consequences.
nonapplause And our country was still profoundly sad because of President Kennedy's death.
nonapplause Now  there are so many things I want to talk with you about today  and just one of them is how the Texas spirit is spreading throughout the Nation.
nonapplause Every once in a while he goes charging off in the wrong direction and gets himself into trouble.
nonapplause Most people are not going to be in bed.
nonapplause This is a call to action.
nonapplause I believe -- that's the first thing.
nonapplause But you must begin today.
nonapplause The problem with that is that running the deficit we're running  when you start to let people take their 2% out  you will diminish the funds we have to pay current retirees.
nonapplause These assumptions are wrong.
nonapplause One of the entrepreneurs  a fellow named Ernest Henley -- he's here.
nonapplause So we need a term to describe the world that encovers not only the people that are winning but the people who aren't.
nonapplause I think Halliburton has got its own chapter  ladies and gentlemen.
nonapplause And he understands as well as anybody that the real appeal of our opponents in this election is  it's your money  let's just take it all now.
nonapplause I mentioned economic strength.
nonapplause And one of the things that I really worked hard to do -- one of my mayors and my neighbor and friend  Pat Hays  from North Little Rock  Arkansas  is here -- you know  to be governor of Arkansas is like being mayor of kind of a nice size city.
nonapplause That  of course  is one of the reasons that led us to cut the power of government in order to release more power back to the people believing in the British character.
nonapplause Months ago  I put forth a detailed plan for Medicare that would reform and modernize it with a voluntary prescription drug benefit.
nonapplause And how many of those nations voted with us in the United Nations?
nonapplause And I know that some of you have been working in these departments for a very long time  for decades.
nonapplause In just a matter of decades  the people of the Americas have thrown juntas and caudillos out of power and they have built democratic governments that reflect their own cultures  their own traditions and their own unique experiences.
nonapplause They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies who would use them without the least bit of hesitation.
nonapplause The Gallery was filled with families  parents  relatives  trying to live with their agony.
nonapplause But the most important thing now is that Japan play a leadership role in getting a WTO agreement in all nine sectors.
nonapplause And he had vetoed a bill to change that.
nonapplause It is too big to he made on the basis of a personality.
nonapplause You know  of all the things that go with this job  I'm more proud of the young men and women in uniform in our country today than of anything else.
nonapplause You often hear it described as foreign aid.
nonapplause In it they said that the broad coalition government was only a front to  in their words  "neutralize Yankee intervention."
nonapplause And they admit that during this time Europe was in the Dark Ages  meaning darkness  ignorance.
nonapplause So today  assuming that you are on our side  I thought I'd give you some ammunition for the coming months.
nonapplause And on balance  these rules have been good for business  not bad  for they ensure honest competition and fair dealing and a level playing field.
nonapplause But in listening to Bill Clinton talk about character  and seeing that finally there is the beginning  at least  of a willingness to accept the fact that the moral crisis is this country's major challenge  you're still faced with difficulties--because even though it's now on the lips  it doesn't yet appear to translate into any kind of real policy.
nonapplause I thank you for all the gifts from Campania  including the beautiful flowers for Hillary.
nonapplause If we act now  we can ensure strong retirement benefits for the baby boom generation without placing an undue burden on our children and grandchildren.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech of Senator Kennedy at Municipal Auditorium  Oklahoma Calif.  Okla.
nonapplause You know if he'd quit talking and start reading  he'd find out what President Eisenhower is doing.
nonapplause So this afternoon  I want to talk about an idea -- an idea that has defined the modern era since the dawn of the Enlightenment  an idea that has now captured the imagination of a majority of humanity  and made our world more secure as a result  so that idea is liberal democracy.
nonapplause In two-and-a-half years  we have come far  two-and-a-half years  we've come a long way.
nonapplause We reorganized our intelligence services.
nonapplause The Soviet navy is not designed for self-defence.

nonapplause The purpose is to help these workers find jobs in growing sectors of our economy.
nonapplause But as parents  as mentioned earlier  of a son deployed  Jill and I understand it's not just the big things that make a difference in your quality of life  it's a lot of little things.
nonapplause Because we've still got problems and headaches.
nonapplause Now  a century ago  economic growth was generated by large industrial organizations  popularly called the trust then.
nonapplause And you never can tell when you might need another friend.
nonapplause Our foreign policy had lost its direction.
nonapplause And even though along the way I thought they did some quite good things -- standing up against communism  signing the Americans With Disabilities Act -- but all the time telling us that the government was the problem.
nonapplause I can tell you that it would have been unthinkable when I was here in 1963 -- we had a lot of problems in 1963 -- we had severe racial problems still  the country was still largely segregated.
nonapplause And here we are in Nashville.
nonapplause In his book  "The Road From Here " Bill Gates says that the digital chip is leading us to the greatest transformation in communications in 500 years  since Gutenberg printed the first Bible in Europe.

nonapplause Home values were in freefall -- nobody knew what the floor was.

nonapplause You may have setbacks  and you may have failures  but you're not done -- you're not even getting started  not by a long shot.
nonapplause And the reason I've asked them to join us is to help make my point -- that when we're talking about taxes and budgets  it's more than numbers that we're talking about.

nonapplause He said  what are you thinking about?
nonapplause It's been cold and cloudy in Washington  I need a suntan.
nonapplause This is America's first all-water National Historic Trail -- and appropriately it begins right here in Jamestown.
nonapplause He was raising your taxes back when I was still making motion pictures.
nonapplause I know people may not want to hear that  but what we've done is we've enshrined a principle that every single person in this country should not be bankrupt when they get sick; that every child who's got a preexisting condition  they can get health care; that small businesses who want to do the right thing by their employees  that they're going to have the capacity to provide health insurance at reasonable rates.
nonapplause And Jack thought about it for just a second  and then he said  "No  Jimmy Stewart for Governor; Ronald Reagan for best friend."
nonapplause My parents worked in the mill  my grandparents did.
nonapplause We drop all rates; we simplify the code; we increase the child credit from $500 to $1 000 per child  which is a very positive addition to the code because it makes the code more fair for people struggling to get ahead.
nonapplause And frankly we need to be able and committed to standing for what is right and what is noble  even if it means standing alone.
nonapplause And if we do that  that means in every community represented in this room  lower interest rates for businesses  for home mortgages  for college loans  for credit cards  for car payments.
nonapplause It's one thing to get the deficit down  another thing to hold it there.
nonapplause It's not a sign of weakness to look for help  to try to answer questions that you don't know the answers to -- it's a sign of strength when you do that.
nonapplause The first thing I want to make clear is that if you are happy with the insurance plan that you have right now  if the costs you're paying and the benefits you're getting are what you want them to be  then you can keep offering that same plan.
nonapplause But that's okay.

nonapplause I'm almost through.
nonapplause And one of the things that impressed me so much is that so many things against all the odds are being done that work.
nonapplause In the same way  we don't test to punish urban schools  we test to renew them.
nonapplause The truth is  better governance is not just an end in itself  it is your path to a lasting democratic stability and your ultimate stability.

nonapplause That's like having a second mortgage  a Mondale mortgage.
nonapplause They call them mandates.
nonapplause What do you think happens to these intense and strong emotions when we start to dilute that constraint?
nonapplause We all do better when we help each other.
nonapplause America faces a choice on November 2nd between a strong and steadfast President and his opponent  who seems to adopt a new position every day.

nonapplause So I said: "Well  we will resist the strike!"
nonapplause You ought to throw some questions at Lynne  too.
nonapplause Many leaders in our administration have come from the ranks of higher education -- Donna Shalala was the Chancellor at the University of Wisconsin.

nonapplause Now they sign them John B. Starkey  whoever he is  San Diego.
nonapplause I am very honored to receive this degree from Hebrew University of Jerusalem -- honored because its founders include Chaim Weizmann  Martin Buber  Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein; honored because it is now one of the world's leading centers of learning and research.
nonapplause And it made me want to go back to school.

nonapplause Ultimately the cost of dealing with this threat will be far higher than confronting it now.
nonapplause They mark progress by the level of education reached by members of their families.
nonapplause That's the first time I've ever given a speech from a Democratic platform."
nonapplause The strength that comes from the confidence born of experience.
nonapplause It's not even a matter of competing talents and achievements.
nonapplause Advancing these frontiers is also a priority of my administration  as Tommy pointed out.
nonapplause It served as the first home of the Grand Ole Opry and it still features great musical acts today.
nonapplause If we do that  I'm pretty confident how it will all come out.
nonapplause It is our job now to pull them together into a coherent plan.
nonapplause He gave more to us than any of us outside his family gave to him.
nonapplause So I ask you  go out there and make sure that's what it's about.
nonapplause Therefore  it's the kind of cure-all which certainly they don't want  and they don't want to buy  and it will be bad for them.
nonapplause Archbishop  thank you very much for being here  as well.

nonapplause The least we can do is to help you to be protected.
nonapplause So the United States does not seek to contain China  nor does a deeper relationship with China mean a weakening of our bilateral alliances.
nonapplause But your personal reputation  Prime Minister  as a man of peace  a man dedicated to seeking that peace with Israel's neighbours  is itself grounds for greater hope.
nonapplause She says when it comes to drugs  please  for yourselves  for your families  for your future  and for your country  just say no.
nonapplause We should not misjudge the force of the challenge that we face - a force that is powerful as well as insidious  that inspires dedication as well as fear  that uses means we cannot adopt to achieve ends we cannot permit.
nonapplause Those people at the bottom of the scale will be taken off the rolls altogether.
nonapplause This is a challenge to the private sector.
nonapplause We know that in this era where we have gone from the bipolar world of the Cold War to a global village with all kinds of new and different threats to our security  only the United States can stand consistently throughout the world for the cause of freedom and democracy and opportunity.

nonapplause Before September the 11th  2001  we thought oceans would protect us forever; that if we saw a gathering threat somewhere else in the world  we could respond to it if we chose -- so chose to do so.
nonapplause As we pursue the enemy in Afghanistan  we feed the innocents.
nonapplause I look forward to transforming these ideas into action.

nonapplause You held up a vision of Mexico for the future  a Mexico united in democracy and in prosperity.
nonapplause Leaders of the Republican Party  they called the passage of this bill “Armageddon.”   Armageddon.
nonapplause And we believe that a country with free political and economic systems is not going to collapse in failure and violence; it is not going to be the source of insecurity for its people  for the region in which it lives or for the world.
nonapplause All the while the people read our leaflets and received the regular promises of peace and democracy and land reform.
nonapplause It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world.
nonapplause The tax cut enacted last year was intended to ensure the long term prosperity of our economy by stimulating savings and investment  and by limiting the total amount of our national wealth devoted to government.
nonapplause And this year  the highest percentage of that potential pool in history has jobs.
nonapplause Now  that doesn't mean this recession is by any means over for the millions of Americans who are still looking for a job or a way to pay the bills.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the President Working for America - Corporate Responsibility

nonapplause America also understands that unprecedented influence brings tremendous responsibilities.
nonapplause Now  people say -- the same people who said six years ago that all these criminals were getting their guns at gun shows and urban flea markets and  therefore  the Brady Bill wouldn't work  now say you can't have background checks at gun shows because it would be so burdensome.
nonapplause So I say to you  the United States  as Alan Greenspan said the other day  cannot be an island of prosperity in a sea of distress.
nonapplause That's why we're helping to sustain jobs in arts communities across the country.
nonapplause Security and prosperity  in turn  allow human creativity to flourish -- but human creativity can only flourish fully in freedom.
nonapplause Peace doesn't come through the weakness of America and its democratic allies: Peace and freedom come through strength.
nonapplause ﻿  President Addresses 2005 National Boy Scout Jamboree
nonapplause We need to move forward.
nonapplause In that changing environment  as always  we must take the facts as they are and think anew about the requirements of national security.
nonapplause And this straw poll had been mightily hyped because it was going to be the first vote of any kind in the 1992 presidential season.
nonapplause As hard-working Americans  I want to leave you with two thoughts about that.
nonapplause My husband is so committed to education because he looks at schools the way a parent looks at schools.
nonapplause But you've helped  you've added representatives at every level of government to strengthen our forces  and now for us to go forward and try to realize our ideals and the things that we've been talking about all these years.
nonapplause He said  "Yes  we have a secret weapon.
nonapplause They're all going up.
nonapplause One of Paul Ray Smith's men said he "was hard in training because he knew we had to be hard in battle."
nonapplause You have just sent a message to some people that need to hear it in Washington  D.C.
nonapplause And after a while  I guess Glen was watching me for over a year or so -- he called me in after we got some things --- he says  I own a small business.
nonapplause And he has now been invited as part of our follow-up to show we're making progress to go on the show again  where he will read a top five list --   -- showing that we can do more with less  he will make each one of them twice as funny as any top 10 list that was there.
nonapplause And yes  I do mean that kind of courage.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President At Democratic National Committee Meeting
nonapplause So far  the Center has received thousands of telephone calls and helped hundreds of parents.
nonapplause The new energy economy of solar power  hydrogen power  blended-fuel vehicles  is basically entrepreneurial  technological  under-funded and without much influence politically.
nonapplause As long as I've got this microphone  I'll out-sound them --   Hecklers
nonapplause We will use every element of our national power to destroy those who seek to do us harm.
nonapplause And the problem  in part  is the malpractice insurance company that covered most of the state has pulled because the rates got so high.
nonapplause So  we work to restore our own economy; we cannot afford to lose sight of our neighbors to the south.
nonapplause So this is a happy day.
nonapplause Now Senator Kerry is proposing massive increases in federal spending.
nonapplause And once again we're the ones with the clear idea of what must be done.
nonapplause This is the reason NASA donated to this institution some of its most sophisticated aviation-related computers last year.
nonapplause ﻿  Speech Receiving Medal of Freedom Award
nonapplause The Jews and the Arabs in the Middle East.
nonapplause So  Proposition 13 was passed.
nonapplause The work we are in is not easy; yet it is essential.
nonapplause For too long the Federal Government has been violating the Constitution in its usurpation of the rights that belong to the States  the local communities  and to the individual people in this country.
nonapplause That will allow trains to operate at closer distances to each other  and that means the existing infrastructure can double its rider capacity.
nonapplause A poet once wrote: "I have fallen in love with American names " and Americans love no name better than the name of freedom.
nonapplause We need a strong economy if we are going to meet our obligations to the underdeveloped world  to maintain our defenses  to meet our needs in education and health and housing.
nonapplause She's never seen a Republican."
nonapplause When the centerpiece of his economic program is backbreaking tax hikes  you can see why my opponent spends so much time using outrageous scare tactics.
nonapplause Our Iraqi brethren are learning that right now  as they held a free election -- Sunni  Shia  Kurd  Indo-European  Arab.
nonapplause Thank you  very much.
nonapplause With an economy that's growing healthier every day  with a country that's still strong in freedom and growing stronger in opportunity  your lives can be as good and productive and as meaningful as you are willing to make them.
nonapplause And we should create opportunities where individuals can  themselves  take the decision how to organize time and the use of time in their lives.
nonapplause So rather than hurling accusations about big-government liberals or mean-spirited conservatives  we're going to have to answer those tough questions.
nonapplause Because freedom looks like a joke in that context.
nonapplause But what we now know is  that properly implemented in the early grades  technology can help children who have learning problems  can lift reading levels  can lift comprehension levels.
nonapplause They want to give the money to me.
nonapplause Religion has a proper place in private and a proper place in public because the public square belongs to all Americans.

nonapplause Yes.
nonapplause And the first one is this: Haven't you often read or heard  and hasn't it made you boil up inside to read and hear  that the cause of the farm problem in the United States  the reason we have all these troubles  are the farmers.
nonapplause But people know in all local communities that we now have a competent  aggressive strategy for dealing with it.
nonapplause Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in those three wars.
nonapplause It took many years for industry to appreciate and develop the range of new products that could flow from this knowledge and every bit as important was the imagination to design and market them effectively.
nonapplause Even though we balanced the budget these last eight years  and run a surplus  and we've eliminated hundreds of programs  we've also doubled investment in education and training.
nonapplause Studies show what many of us have believed  that such exposure causes more aggression and anti-social behavior.
nonapplause And now they contemplate an outright assault on the deepest foundations of the moral life and character of our people  the very pillars  in fact  of self-discipline and self-government.
nonapplause I have a concern and we need to address it and we will address it  that we are not matriculating sufficient numbers of engineers  technologists--engineers and scientists--from our colleges and universities.
nonapplause And it turned out that the child that was in a wheelchair was one of these Make A Wish children  a child with a very serious illness.

nonapplause We also seek to support a new  more drug-free America through prevention.
nonapplause -- said that he cannot think of one of our first term tax cuts that he would extend.
nonapplause That's all that counts.
nonapplause And my call my call to particularly the students here -- is that  in a responsible society  not only do you have a responsibility to make right choices  but you've got a responsibility to help somebody who hurts  to make somebody's life a little brighter  to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself.
nonapplause Your responsibility is not to a particular party -- and that's important for people to understand -- or to a particular administration or to a President.
nonapplause And  in addition to that  they would not have the funds to guarantee that when all the baby boomers retire  we wouldn't impose an unconscionable burden on our children and grandchildren  through the cost of medical care  Medicaid  Social Security.
nonapplause And they need a clear national message  and they have to do this without one big advantage the Republicans have  which is they won't have a theological message  that basically paints the other guys as evil.
nonapplause Now  the reason I think some of our friends in Congress have a problem with that is because last year discretionary spending went up 8 percent; and since we got into the surplus mode around here over the last couple of years  we've had a total of three years where  frankly  Congress and the last administration  in my view  overdid it with respect to discretionary spending.
nonapplause We have to find a way to lift up all the world's religious traditions and give the people who've been left behind a chance to share our future.

nonapplause So we set priorities and pay down debt.
nonapplause How did those things change?
nonapplause The economic expansion is also translating into higher than projected federal revenues  as we believed would happen.
nonapplause Senator Kerry and others have said  well  when he voted against those systems back in the '80s  those were just the systems that Cheney cancelled when he was Secretary of Defense.
nonapplause Because this election fundamentally is not about the Democratic Party  it's about the American people.
nonapplause What do you do?
nonapplause But with that one exception  let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt.
nonapplause This is a hard fight against enemies who wear no uniform  organize in secret  and target the innocent.
nonapplause I believe that the continuation of this legacy in our time depends as much as anything else on whether we actually believe in our common humanity and the primary importance of acting on our increasing interdependence.
nonapplause That is the unique role you occupy in American democracy.
nonapplause Now  this is a big deal.
nonapplause Government can't be there day in  day out  to provide discipline and guidance and the love that it takes to raise a child.
nonapplause That worked out to less than a dollar an hour  which may seem like a bargain  but it's probably all I was worth.
nonapplause But what such countries really need is not more government but good government.
nonapplause And I wouldn't worry about whether we're going to get there.
nonapplause We want to make all health insurance -- including HSA insurance -- more accessible  by allowing workers to buy health coverage from out-of-state insurers.

nonapplause I have to start out today making a bit of a confession.
nonapplause Now  when we talk about this going back thing  I notice some Republicans say  well  he just wants to bash the previous administration.
nonapplause We tried it their way for 12 years; we tried it our way for eight years.
nonapplause And the punchline was  "I want everybody who wants to go to heaven to stand up right now."
nonapplause The people who are the experts understand what that extra three feet means for this mighty river.
nonapplause It will shape our future by strengthening the bonds between Americans and their kin in the Nordic nations.
nonapplause We should not act as if nuclear weaponry is negotiable and debatable.
nonapplause It speaks to whether or not we're going to be true friends with the neighbors to the south.
nonapplause Tax increases simply give the Federal Government more to spend on Federal programs that create constituencies and then require even greater spending."
nonapplause Look at what I'm worrying about -- the struggles between India and Pakistan  between the Hindus and the Muslims; in Kosovo  the struggle between the Albanians and the Serbs.
nonapplause Now when they show you pictures of the Sumerians they try and make you think that they were white people.
nonapplause They are problems that the American government has never before faced  and they require new thinking  courageous leadership and bold action.

nonapplause Yes  we must have common standards and requirements.
nonapplause Now  I'm not talking here about Social Security  but of the many formula spending programs.
nonapplause And now  I know myself that the reason for that is clear: that the income tax is a system that in principle deprives us of control of all our own money.
nonapplause I suppose that I have spent more time in classrooms than any previous president  partly because I was a governor for 12 years  and partly because I still do it with some frequency.
nonapplause We will be alert not to miss the moment when the Soviets turn to genuine detente.

nonapplause That's why we passed the Family and Medical Leave law  and I've asked Congress to expand it again.

nonapplause We will go bankrupt.
nonapplause Once again  we want to thank all of you for your commitment to the cause we all serve  and for supporting fine members of Congress  like Congressman Jon Porter.
nonapplause You're passing it along as it was intended to be passed.
nonapplause On the other hand  I believe that one of the things that all Democrats believe that is right is that no country has yet solved the problem -- no rich country -- of how do you get the benefits of the global economy -- trade  technology and investment -- and still help the people that will get displaced from the global economy in an adequate and rapid way  so that they can immediately return to the winner's circle.
nonapplause At the same time  in our view  some of the blame must also go to the labour movement in the West  since to some extent it is hampered by strictly national ideas of its actual role and interests.
nonapplause About 100 yards into the race her throat closed up and she couldn't breathe.

nonapplause I am not afraid of that burden.
nonapplause But 2 weeks later the Republicans held a fundraiser at the same place.
nonapplause We were just talking  Terry and I were -- and Joe -- we were just talking about the fact that part of their business right now has to do with rail lines and doing some work for Amtrak.

nonapplause Anyone who says that the future is easy is wholly wrong.
nonapplause And the Senator from Massachusetts has given us ample doubts about his judgment and the attitude he brings to bear on vital issues of national security.
nonapplause It will be followed by the Channel Tunnel in 1993  which will be the first time in our history that we have had a land border with another country that speaks a different language.

nonapplause And in the moments when these officers were under fire or choking on smoke  they weren't thinking about themselves.

nonapplause They have ceased to waste their love on the white man  and they have ceased turning their nonviolent cheek to the violent white man.
nonapplause The crime rate is going down in almost every major area in America today  but the rate of violent random crime among very young people is still going up.
nonapplause And insofar as we reward people for doing the right things  then those who are especially well-positioned will do even better.
nonapplause I just want to say a word or two about that  and how it relates to everything I have said before.
nonapplause There's no city in the country that's even close to that.
nonapplause Now  I want to say just a few words about all the rather interesting hoopla that's been going on here.
nonapplause And we cannot have it both ways in the war in Iraq.
nonapplause You want to make the plunge and grow into a bigger  better person  but you have all kinds of reservations.
nonapplause We see unprecedented international cooperation to try to stop slaughter in the Balkans  where we did it.
nonapplause Of course  other people now look at our tanks and think of what a Boston newspaper columnist -- him  not me -- called Pee-Wee's Armored Adventure.
nonapplause A primary education boosts the farmers' output by about 8 percent.
nonapplause I teach and mentor at-risk teenagers  because too many of the pages of their stories are filled with anxiety  depression  substance abuse  academic failure  and despair.

nonapplause This Government would rather force these economies on the family than make economies themselves.

nonapplause It's about 900 000 -- 90 000 seniors in Chicago without any drug coverage.
nonapplause And some others  including members of my staff  wanted immediately to open up a verbal barrage against them.
nonapplause Stemming the tide of dropouts will require turning around our low-performing schools.
nonapplause But they can be helpful.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause We are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could not change.
nonapplause So  I'm very grateful for that.
nonapplause It was to use tax incentives and to stimulate the economy in those areas.
nonapplause But the whole country pays a price  as well  because less lending leads to fewer jobs and lower spending  which leads to less lending -- a vicious cycle that delays our recovery.
nonapplause And the Jesuits -- we have a great French priest by the name of Teilhard de Chardin -- who was a scientist  paleontologist  and a Jesuit.
nonapplause Agriculture absorbs a preponderant share of the Community budget and leaves insufficient resources for other areas equally relevant to the problems of advanced industrial societies  especially at a time of economic recession.
nonapplause If you look at  in recent years  Rwanda  Sierra Leon  the Balkans  East Tambour  the Middle East  or Northern Ireland until  God bless them  my people finally did the right thing a few weeks ago.
nonapplause Many other states use it as well.
nonapplause So these results were both disturbing and encouraging.
nonapplause Let me pose the question they never got around to in San Francisco.
nonapplause When people have emergency situations  where do you go to get the information?
nonapplause And suddenly  a credit card becomes less of a lifeline and more of an anchor.
nonapplause We'd still have problems with the health care system -- the problems with this never go away in any country.
nonapplause And don't tell us that $2.00 a gallon at the tank is the best that we can do.
nonapplause What theoretically started out to be only a 2-year trial period  which was supposed to have provided Amtrak time to become self-sufficient  ended up as a mobile Federal money-burning machine.
nonapplause The cause of peace and freedom and decency have never had a more tireless or tenacious advocate.
nonapplause The Texas public schools were having considerable difficulties.
nonapplause Think of it: We're not only saying to children from very poor families who think they would never be able to go to college  people who may not have stellar academic records in high school  if you're willing to work hard and take a chance  you can at least go to your local community college and we'll pay for the first year.
nonapplause We've used the full might of the United States  including law enforcement and intelligence and so forth  but also our military capability to go after terrorists wherever they plot and plan and organize against us  and also -- and this was a new departure -- was to go after those who support terror  those who sponsor terror  those who provide a sanctuary or safe harbor for terror.
nonapplause Short of the Medal of Honor  the Distinguished Service Cross is the highest decoration that can be earned by a member of the United States Army.
nonapplause This port  this city has been a great launching site for ships  missiles  planes  and you are about to launch me into orbit over Texas later this afternoon.
nonapplause I want to thank Christine for coming.
nonapplause We want to help families who have got children.
nonapplause All of that  of course  especially affects the efforts of these two presidents to secure their own people and their future.
nonapplause And then we had the great civil rights movement of the '60s because of Martin Luther King and all the others; because the Supreme Court was visionary and brave -- and let's be honest: because the Congress and the country were conscience-stricken after President Kennedy was murdered.
nonapplause And by facilitating the creation of a clean energy economy  building this 21st century energy infrastructure will help us lay a foundation for lasting growth and prosperity.
nonapplause Certainly  it will be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move first.
nonapplause And in 1988 or '89  I went up to Long Island in the summertime.
nonapplause And then here's Mondale up here -- and to President Reagan's credit  he gave Vice President Bush a lot to do and they had more of a systematic relationship.
nonapplause But this nation has made a decision: We will not retreat in the face of brutality  and we will never live at the mercy of tyrants or terrorists.
nonapplause Israel  too  must redouble its efforts by alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people and by avoiding actions that undermine the long-term viability of a two-state solution.
nonapplause It is a form of diplomacy in which we can all take part.
nonapplause It's because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we're no longer divided  north and south  slave and free.
nonapplause That's a lot of folks out there  working people  people who are working hard to make this country go  to keep our economy strong and to keep our communities strong  and most important of all  to raise their children and keep their families strong.
nonapplause It was a time when our nation failed to live up to its ideals  when our nation broke the trust with our people that is the very foundation of our democracy.
nonapplause And we're going to keep the economy going  and we're going to keep going until we get this country out of debt  for the first time since 1835.
nonapplause I ask you to understand that we have certain responsibilities because no other nation in the world can do the things we are called upon to do.
nonapplause When Hillary and I were discussing whether I should make this race  way back in '91  well over eight years ago now  one of the things that I hoped I could do was to bring whatever powers of persuasion and understanding of history  as well as human psychology that I've acquired over the years  to the process of peace in the world.
nonapplause Cocaine use is declining  and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began.
nonapplause As we all know  devotion to that land has also been the source of conflict and bloodshed for too long.
nonapplause And the man behind the counter said  "All right  come back in 10 years and get your car."
nonapplause Well  my means of travel in that early era was hitchhiking  and I hitchhiked from one radio station to another.
nonapplause And then there are the disparities that we don't even know about because our data collection methods still aren't up to par.
nonapplause I hope to be one of them one of these days.
nonapplause It really matters whether you think and whether you put your feelings into organized fashion  and whether that then organizes the process for developing specific policies.
nonapplause For that I deeply appreciate your being here.
nonapplause The Soviet Red Shield program actually dwarfs our SDI.
nonapplause And General Shalikashvili addressed that.
nonapplause Well  I knew they weren't popular.
nonapplause Good afternoon.
nonapplause We can't just give up because the politics are hard.
nonapplause So  yes  some say that it's time for a change.
nonapplause That's what we want from you.
nonapplause This is my 11th visit since the storm hit.
nonapplause I mentioned at this convention in 1980 that we needed this.
nonapplause That help makes possible an extraordinary response from the courageous and capable nongovernmental organizations that have been at the scene  and that support all kinds of efforts that the government is engaged in.
nonapplause Now  the contributory retirements are sometimes called middle-class entitlements because they benefit everybody.
nonapplause And  always to remember: "No message could be any clearer.
nonapplause And we knew that economic freedom meant paying less of the American family's earnings to the Government  and so we cut personal income taxes by 25 percent.
nonapplause We expect $260 billion more in private savings in 1984 than in 1981.
nonapplause I want to thank Hillary for what she's done.
nonapplause I want you to be happy about this good time.
nonapplause It's the latest in a line of proud firsts: the first time you saw your son or daughter with that Navy haircut  that first time you saw them in their summer whites  and today the first time you'll see them as officers.
nonapplause Of course  we do.
nonapplause Mr. Hall did the Gateshead Metro Centre which I visited during the election campaign as a matter of fact—a very successful result we got from visiting it!
nonapplause Mr. Prime Minister  today we worked to fulfill our duty --bring our countries closer together than ever before.
nonapplause But with that  I'll stop  and an opportunity for you to ask questions.
nonapplause The question is the future.
nonapplause In the Greater Middle East  we are encouraging free markets  democracy  and tolerance -- because these are the ideas and aspirations that overcome violence  and turn societies to the pursuits of peace.
nonapplause Ladies and gentlemen  I appreciate what all the previous speakers have said and I very much appreciate your support here at this fundraiser for the Democratic Party and for what we are trying to do in the next eight weeks.
nonapplause That's why he included $2 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to upgrade and expand community health centers  including the $1.3 million to fund the one that we're here to open today.
nonapplause At Treasury we will have a new Secretary  subject to the will of the Senate  who is one of the truly outstanding people that I have known in my life .
nonapplause When a political party votes  in 1935  98 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage  I know what the party stands for; and when that same political party in 1960 votes in the House of Representatives 85 percent against $1.25 minimum wage in 1960  I know the Republican Party stands where it has always stood-against; not for  but against.
nonapplause But it's a funny thing about our system here in America.
nonapplause Would you like to stand?
nonapplause One thing is certain: The time for business as usual has passed.
nonapplause There's no mention  for example  in the book of al Qaeda; no mention in the book of Osama bin Laden.
nonapplause Wrongs  obviously.
nonapplause We've created or saved up to 1.6 million jobs  according to the CBO -- the Congressional Budget Office -- through the Recovery Act.
nonapplause When I was a kid  I had lots of really good friends in two very different places.
nonapplause I want it to be normal when I go some place and say we go together and we got into people's homes and we visit with them at night and they're glad to see us and they understand that we're all on the same side and we're trying to save these kids' lives and give them a future.
nonapplause There's a lot of things I don't know about your Governor.

nonapplause I want to thank Congressman Ed Pastor  of Arizona; Congressman Sam Farr  from California  for joining me; and former Congresswoman Karen English  from Arizona  for being here.
nonapplause Yet unfortunately  there is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail  old ways of thinking; a conception of power that is rooted in the past rather than in the future.
nonapplause Despite some promising scientific breakthroughs  we know the fight against AIDS is nowhere near won.
nonapplause Of the 20 best elementary schools in Kentucky  10 of them have over half of their kids eligible for free or reduced school lunch.
nonapplause I think the Democrats represent oftentimes thermometers.
nonapplause Perhaps that's one difference between our approach and that of the other side.
nonapplause And this series of initiatives that we're going to be debating over the next months will be aimed  if it's done right  at easing the burden of the working people in the country.
nonapplause I know the town is older than America  and the spirit of independence here -- and across New Hampshire -- is still very strong.
nonapplause To them  I commend the words of Dr. King when he said  "Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred."
nonapplause Speaking of regulations  for some businesses  regulations became so excessive that it seemed there were always inspectors around and government paperwork to fill out.
nonapplause We don't have enough primary care physicians in America  and I think we all know it.
nonapplause A Labour Government without a Commons majority  forced to carry out the minimum of Conservative policies  is a very poor alternative to a Conservative Government with a majority  which actually believes in Conservative policies and carries them all out in good time.
nonapplause Well  that sure clears things up.
nonapplause But the good news is  the federal government's shut down today.
nonapplause And you know what?
nonapplause Well  I didn't really feel that way  but since you insist  okay.
nonapplause But the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been reinvented.
nonapplause Then  it took four years for your economy to recover the lost ground; this time  only a year after the crisis  Mexico grew by more than five percent and is expected to grow strongly this year  too.

nonapplause ﻿  President Rallies Troops at Travis Air Force Base
nonapplause If not now  we will never get around to it.
nonapplause And I just think that that ought to be taken into account in 1996 because there was bitter  bitter partisan opposition to both of those things.
nonapplause Believe me  we need Kit in Washington to help work the same kind of magic in Congress that he did here in your State capital.
nonapplause If we are to meet the challenges of our time  we must take the corrupting influence of special interest money out of politics.

nonapplause Just as over and over again  Jim Santini has come through for the great State of Nevada.
nonapplause And I must tell you  it has been an extraordinarily inspiring and rewarding experience.

nonapplause It's a wonderful  natural beauty of rivers and hills and valleys.

nonapplause Because half the American people are working for the same or lower incomes they were making 15 years ago.
nonapplause The suffering of the unemployed is a deep concern to me  and don't let anyone tell you differently.
nonapplause One of the most important things in this complicated age of zillions of problems is that I identify what it is as President I can do and what it is I need someone else's help to do -- of all the things we can spend our time on here in the White House and this government  which things are most important and which things will spark the largest release of energy in a positive and constructive way around the country.
nonapplause America's economic success begins elsewhere  in more humble settings: in garages and basements and rented storefronts.
nonapplause We've started that process.
nonapplause The dictators of your past hoped the hard times would silence your voices  banish your leaders  destroy your spirit.

nonapplause Now and in the future  this great republic will lead the cause of freedom and peace.

nonapplause The whole exercise underlines the commitment  not just of this Government but of this country if we are to prosper  to the importance of small firms as creators of jobs  as creators of new prosperity  and the purpose of the exercise is to underline the extent to which the climate has been transformed in the last two or three years.

nonapplause The discipline of parenting is realizing that on the day those precious bundles were born into your life  you didn't cease to matter  but you surely ceased to matter very much.
nonapplause That is the central thing I have to say to you about the world in which you live.
nonapplause But it's very important.
nonapplause Oh yes  jobs are important  and schools are important for these young people  and better health  better hospitals.

nonapplause In many areas we will be defending past gains.
nonapplause Secretary Stimson said some years ago  I think in 1947  that everything that we do in the United States must be framed with reference to the world around us  every domestic problem that we face really has its counterpart in our foreign relations.

nonapplause And in this fight some of the hardest duties have come to the men and women of our armed forces.
nonapplause And if we live up to that responsibility  if we're fighting for the American people with the same sense of urgency that they feel in their own lives -- then I am absolutely confident we're going to be able to look back at the end of this year and say that things are getting better; that we've reignited confidence in our economy  in America  and in each other; that we've restored a sense of responsibility here in Washington; and that  above all  we've begun to renew the American Dream and keep it alive not just for this time but for all time.
nonapplause But I ask you to consider this.
nonapplause And so Ken is totally responsible.
nonapplause For people who don't know exactly what they are  let me say that charter schools are public schools that make a simple agreement: in exchange for public funding  they get fewer regulations and less red tape  but they have to meet high expectations  and they keep their charter only so long as their customers are satisfied they're doing a good job.
nonapplause I mean  there are big differences in economic policy  in crime policy  in health care policy  in education policy  environmental policy  right down the line.

nonapplause What is his judgment like?
nonapplause As the Ambassador who served in London so well told you  we have made great strides in the last ten years  not by doing really anything new but by trying the age-old recipes of enlarging the capacity for enterprise and liberty under a rule of law—and it is that which gives the dynamic  the energy  the vitality  the success of the nation; success has come not only to those who lead in business and industry but success has … .
nonapplause They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility.
nonapplause That is an extremely serious error in judgment that constitutes a reckless disregard for the safety of the American people.
nonapplause I want to thank you all for your welcome and I want to thank my good friend  Janice  for her instruction.

nonapplause And I'll tell you why.

nonapplause If we have stronger families  we will have a stronger America.
nonapplause And we will be working on the same thing here at the Federal level where that is needed  as we have done on our tax program  eliminating the marriage tax penalty.
nonapplause So Erskine Bowles says  "Mr. President  tell Bob that that's like the farmer from Louisiana with three hogs."
nonapplause I told you that I wanted health insurance for every American  very much like what we have in my home state.
nonapplause But we shouldn't get caught denying that there are no problems for these doctors.
nonapplause My view is that the 21st century  which most people would characterize as an age of globalization  is instead an age of global interdependence
nonapplause How can we do this?
nonapplause In just over two decades  the people of Latin America transcended what many assumed was an inescapable reality.
nonapplause And the fact is  it took a long time to dig ourselves into this economic hole; it's going to take some time to dig ourselves out.
nonapplause and carried to jail and arrested   Yes!
nonapplause You sit here in November 1960  but you have to make a judgment of the future.
nonapplause Together  they formed the “Sisterhood of the Traveling Battle Dress Uniforms” --   -- I know  it's cute -- a support network for young women going through similar experiences of sadness and loss while their fathers and mothers are deployed.
nonapplause But whether you've been here for 60 years or 60 days -- because we also know there are a lot of new folks who are just joining Treasury -- it's wonderful to see a group of people who work so hard every day and make such a strong commitment to this country.
nonapplause But more brilliant than we think.
nonapplause And when you put it all together  we wound up with more economic progress and social progress than the country has had  certainly  in our lifetime.
nonapplause The countries have completed comprehensive needs assessments which give us a guide post of what needs to be done and with the single exception of the Maldives  sufficient funds have been promised or secured to meet the needs in the countries that were hardest hit.
nonapplause Though he proved them wrong every day  he was a canny fellow.
nonapplause Yet 4 years after our efforts began  small voices in the night are sounding the call to go back -- back to the days of drift  the days of torpor  timidity  and taxes.
nonapplause But if there aren't rules in place to guard against the recklessness of a few  and they're allowed to exploit consumers and take on excessive risk  it starts a race to the bottom that results in all of us losing.
nonapplause So all the debates with Mr. Khrushchev  and all the things which we may say to him pale in significance to the relative power of the two systems.
nonapplause And finally: "I've always said it was a good idea.
nonapplause But it will give millions of families resigned to financial ruin a chance to rebuild.
nonapplause Just this morning we received the more welcome news; at 8:30 they released the statistics.

nonapplause But in our budget and in our plans for education reform  we also ask this: we ask that in return for getting help that you  the people of Montana  or the people of any state  develop an accountability system that says to the good taxpayers  our children are learning; an accountability system that will tell us whether or not progress is being made.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at the President's Volunteer Action Awards Luncheon
nonapplause She feels good about.
nonapplause I believe it is time to regain control of our own economy.
nonapplause There is a myth in Washington  they say all we've got to do is just raise the taxes a little bit and we'll solve the deficit.
nonapplause We can have a peaceful world.
nonapplause If we warm for the next 50 years at the rate of the last 10  whole island nations in the Pacific will flood.
nonapplause On the other hand  there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.
nonapplause The people here are giving 100 percent  and we should  too.

nonapplause Today Tracy gets a degree and she's planning to work in pediatrics at a local hospital.
nonapplause Palestinian elections are a new promise that reflects the interaction between peace and democracy.

nonapplause Tonight we celebrate the day this university began -- the laying of a cornerstone that marks a milestone in the entire American journey  because on this day  near this place  200 years ago  the cornerstone was laid for the first building in the first university in a nation that had only recently been born.
nonapplause They remind us that if America stays engaged in the global economy  and if our policies continue to reward hard work  investment  and enterprise  our nation will remain the world's economic leader  and our children and grandchildren will lead lives of opportunity  and prosperity  and hope.
nonapplause Before I was President  I had the privilege of being governor for a dozen years  and I loved it and I was not burned out on it.
nonapplause And we also eliminate the death tax.
nonapplause That is not the way we are going to survive.
nonapplause Some individuals go on so-called educational ocean cruises or purchase sky boxes at sports arenas and write them off as business expense.
nonapplause And our last bulletin -- and that was some time ago -- was that they  52 of them  healthy and sound  were getting ready to embark in the American planes for Wiesbaden  Germany.
nonapplause You know  in the field of drug and alcohol abuse there's something called the enabling concept: If I don't do something about your behavior  then I enable it to happen.
nonapplause So we have to find a way to reduce the deficit  for example  and spend more on education  and spend more on preserving the environment because they're our children and our future.
nonapplause There are several states that are already spending more money on prisons than they are on higher education -- several states.
nonapplause This has enormous potential to make educational gains more widely available in poor rural areas  in under-served urban areas  in places where finances have been a real problem.
nonapplause And all they've said is  we're going to try to manufacture safer guns  and we're going to try to use more responsible dealers.
nonapplause Thank you on behalf of the American people.
nonapplause I know both the blessing and the price of freedom.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by the Vice President to Troops and Families
nonapplause The Baldrige Award is the highest presidential honor given to an American organization for quality achievement and for performance excellence.
nonapplause But what are we going to do?
nonapplause He's sort of a symbol of our broad-based and ecumenical approach in this administration.
nonapplause Martin Luther King said  progress does not roll along on the wheels of inevitability; it is brought by people who are willing to work hard  to be co-workers with God.
nonapplause Perhaps most important  he understood that in order for us to preserve our timeless values  people have to change.
nonapplause By the time he ran for President in 1972  Senator McGovern was not only a hero in war  but a stalwart voice for peace in Vietnam.
nonapplause With Tom's support  we will work to make the Bush tax cuts permanent.
nonapplause It is a different story when you know what you are seeing.
nonapplause That is good news for their people and it is good for America's economic future.
nonapplause The contract says  vote for the Republicans  put us in charge in Washington  and here is what we will do.
nonapplause All of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead this country.
nonapplause And I do not want our retirement to bankrupt our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren.
nonapplause We don't start to pay them until they start to -- until they actually get things going here.
nonapplause Don't think he isn't pressing constantly for the interests of North Carolina.
nonapplause Manny Fernandez  thanks for coming -- he's the Chairman.
nonapplause And together  on November 2nd  we'll to see our cause forward to victory.
nonapplause But as you form your own families you will no doubt feel the pressure of trying to balance the demands of work and family; and doing a good job at both in a world that moves faster and faster  and often leaves parents less and less time and energy for their children.
nonapplause And because he wouldn't vote for the Homeland Security Bill that the President put before the Congress (which he  the President himself  had opposed for 8 months before)  then he decided he was for it.
nonapplause May I just say one thing to you?
nonapplause We can agree to disagree.
nonapplause In the words of the prophet Isaiah  "To the captives  'come out ' -- and to those in darkness  'be free.'"
nonapplause But there is a lot more to do  and I ask you to work with me to make sure we do these things properly.
nonapplause Take the case of the small businessman.
nonapplause Sick societies don't produce young men like Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy  who placed his body between mine and the man with the gun simply because he felt that's what his duty called for him to do.
nonapplause He called for action to establish conditions of freedom throughout the world  to strengthen our Western alliances and the United Nations  and he particularly emphasized these words which have meaning for us today.
nonapplause But we plainly live in a world that is changing so fast where people are exposed to so many forces that the ties that bind us are stretched more than there were in the world in which I grew up.
nonapplause But we do have a whole set of new problems in the world that directly relate to the fact that the Cold War is over and things are more open now  and it's easier for people and ideas and money and technology to move around and cross national boundaries.
nonapplause This balanced approach has worked.
nonapplause This house has been burned down; in 1814 the British troops came in here -- we were having a banquet  and everybody had to run.
nonapplause First may I say how pleased we are that this Conference is being held in London.
nonapplause As a judge on one of our nation's most important appellate courts  Judge Bork has handed down tough but fair decisions that have not only protected the rights of the accused but the rights of the victims  as well.
nonapplause It's not just localized to this area.
nonapplause It insists on accountability  it promotes excellence  but it especially emphasizes educating people.
nonapplause And so one turns and thinks well what about the pensioners of the future  and in judging what a Conservative Government will do about promises for the future  I always commend people to look not at those who boast most  but at the records in the past  and I want just therefore to draw to your attention the very good pensions record that successive Conservative Governments have had.
nonapplause And we will meet those commitments.
nonapplause The terrorists regard the entire world as a battlefield.
nonapplause And we see the culture of service and responsibility growing around us.
nonapplause I made that mistake a few years ago.
nonapplause Will you be ready?
nonapplause And they thought we would solve the civil rights challenges of America through the Congress  through the courts  in a lawful way.
nonapplause It's called the Republican Party.
nonapplause Let me begin by extending a warm welcome to all of you  especially those who have traveled very great distances  as many of you have  to help celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.
nonapplause I also want to thank Jill Biden.
nonapplause Justice Scalia and Cardinal Hickey and all the others here -- you stole my line about 50 percent of my four Chiefs of Staff being Italian.
nonapplause "Go out and fight for your beliefs.
nonapplause I know because I've worked more closely with George Bush than with any other member of the administration.
nonapplause We have substantially reduced the coverage both of Capital Transfer Tax and of Capital Gains Tax.
nonapplause And we've got some islands of excellence  but we assume that we can't substantially turn this around.
nonapplause This was all done by some 2 000 of your companions in the business world who volunteered and even put up the money to fund their activity.
nonapplause You know  sooner or later  I have learned in life that if you cannot kill jail or occupy all of your adversaries.
nonapplause The way you cheered  I sort of thought the Bears had come in --   -- or maybe the Lady Bears.
nonapplause In the Middle East  it remains difficult to bring an end to historic conflicts  but we're not discouraged.
nonapplause This one's a no-brainer  because this is the bare minimum we should do for our kids to help their parents make good choices.
nonapplause Two of our leading associations  the U.S.-India Business Council and your Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  will launch a dialogue to take our infotech trade to new heights  to create more jobs and more opportunities in both our nations.
nonapplause We're on the upward road again.
nonapplause President  I want to take a message back to the South.
nonapplause You bet we can.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks at the Annual Convention of the National Association of Counties in Baltimore  Maryland
nonapplause You can't come to my meeting and discuss those four subjects unless at the end  you promise in writing to take some specific action to make one of those four problems better.
nonapplause You used to be able to get covered if you were on Medicare for a heart bypass operation  but you couldn't get help with a Lipitor prescription that might help you avoid having to have the bypass surgery in the first place.
nonapplause Well  see  here's where the truth that God has shared with us through His Son and through His scripture becomes so relevant.
nonapplause It means a second kind of strength.
nonapplause The promise of our future lies in the world.
nonapplause There's a story about a young fellow riding a motorcycle.
nonapplause And I think we need to be thinking about the individual when it comes time to making the Social Security system work better  because if you allow a person to take some of their own money  and it compounds with a rate of interest  it means the nest egg that person is going to have is going to be more closely tied -- more closely resemble that which the government -- the promise the government can't keep.
nonapplause Now  people say  well  why don't you pay all the debt off.
nonapplause But while I was there I met women who walked 12 to 15 hours from remote villages to take out loans -- some as small as $1  to invest in dairy cows  plows or goods to sell at market.
nonapplause I am the son and grandson of Navy admirals  and I was born into America's service.
nonapplause My mother's father  who we call "South Side " before there was room-to-room speakers he had a speaker in every house  in every room in his house  and he played it 24 hours a day at -- on the highest volume he could put it on.
nonapplause First of all  we have to recognize that we have larger responsibilities on the health care front.
nonapplause One was to make sure that the American Dream was alive and well for all people without regard to their race  their income  or their region.
nonapplause I urge the Congress to stand absolutely firm for the right of religious freedom.
nonapplause Let me begin by saying that seven years ago when I had the honor to become President of the United States  I sat down alone and sort of made a list of the things that I hoped could be done to create the kind of world that I wanted our children to live in  in the new century -- a world where the interests of the United States I thought were quite clear: in peace and stability; in democracy and prosperity.
nonapplause We cut those taxes for everybody and not for any particular group.
nonapplause It's not being built to pursue peace there or economic and social reform.
nonapplause Well  we just had a great duck season in Arkansas and a great deer season in New Hampshire  and not a single hunter lost their guns.
nonapplause We want to stop people making you pay more taxes so they could pay less by having a phony relocation to some tax haven  when they're really operating here.
nonapplause And we're going to do it.
nonapplause He won the respect of young men whom he counseled away from gangs and drugs  and the love of little children for whom he always had a piece of candy.
nonapplause It includes for each person 5 cents a day of rice  corn meal  dried eggs  skim milk  and they are going to add lard at the end of the summer.
nonapplause We don't shirk from any challenge.
nonapplause If you look at what's happened from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East to North Africa and Northern Ireland and South Africa to Haiti  if you look at the fact that in North Korea -- with North Korea we just concluded an agreement to make certain that that nation becomes a nonnuclear nation  not selling nuclear materials to others.
nonapplause This festival today is a celebration of those very ideals and a celebration of America's belief.
nonapplause I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin for being here  and tell you that I think that he is one of the finest public servants in America today  and one of the greatest members of the U.S. Senate.
nonapplause Within weeks  the legislation passed overwhelmingly  with a vote of 87 to twelve in the Senate.
nonapplause And so it wasn't as if this is just an across the board criticism for the sake of criticizing the Bush administration.
nonapplause Americans respect the value and the sanctity of human life.
nonapplause I pray  with all my heart  that I will be able to take every single one of them home safe when we finish our mission here."
nonapplause To live with dignity.
nonapplause Did it make a difference for America?
nonapplause Treatment programs have helped some Americans  but their success rate is low and recidivism is common.
nonapplause The solution we seek is not decreasing what others send us  but increasing what we send them.
nonapplause But just as surely as single-digit inflation started interest rates coming down  getting those interest rates down so that people can buy automobiles and take mortgages out on homes and so forth  that will dramatically drive unemployment back down to single digits  too.
nonapplause Contrary to what people say  I don't neglect any issues.
nonapplause Even though our economy is changing  a great many Americans still rely on these pensions for security in their retirement years.
nonapplause I also want to thank Senators Casey and Carper as well for being here; Representatives Brady and Fattah --I'm trying to make sure I'm catching everybody.
nonapplause But I can't help wondering whether after four months in office  after spending 2 880 hours dealing with Congress and fielding questions from the media  whether you ever wonder if you made the right choice.
nonapplause Mr. President  it is a great honor and a source of joy for me to be with you today.
nonapplause Now during that 4-year period  the other side of the program which I announced in South Dakota was one in which we will have Government policies which will see to it that farm income in that period does not fall.
nonapplause There are even some people who want to erode that tax cut so that we can cut taxes for people who don't really need it in this budget program.
nonapplause Over the last several weeks  the President and I have been visiting different parts of the country to talk about the long-term health of Social Security program.
nonapplause We can see it in a whole range of issues  from the promotion of gay marriage to the destruction of innocent life in the womb.
nonapplause You've got to do a certain amount of that.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks by Vice President at Tribute to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
nonapplause We've got to have these same high standards in high school  with an emphasis on math and science.
nonapplause We've gone from a culture where we once watched "Leave it to Beaver" and now we watch "Beavis and Butthead."
nonapplause This is health care that we own  we manage and we keep.
nonapplause What if the Al Qaida members infiltrated across the borders of Iraq the way they are in Afghanistan?
nonapplause When we don't have basic rules of the road in place that assures that consumers aren't abused and tricked  and investors don't know what's going on  then something's got to change.
nonapplause That wasn't all that long ago.
nonapplause Well  in thEfield of foreign policy  he says we muSt tur.
nonapplause “Play 60” was one of the signature programs of the NFL.
nonapplause They're going to know that there are brighter days ahead; that their future is full of boundless possibilities.
nonapplause I'm "POTUS."
nonapplause Or we can accept that preventing the disease and destruction climate change can bring will be infinitely cheaper than letting future generations try to clean up the mess  especially when you consider that greenhouse gases  once emitted into the atmosphere  last and have a destructive environmental effect for at least a hundred years.
nonapplause I hope  of course  some day to reciprocate your great hospitality by welcoming you and Mrs. Obama to Ireland  where we will offer you the warmest of Irish welcomes  I can assure you.
nonapplause And as I reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years  it seems to me that his life bent towards justice.
nonapplause You were then pioneers as you built the world's greatest industrial machine  and now again you are pioneers as you make the great transition into a new economy and a new century.
nonapplause I want everybody to understand this.
nonapplause ﻿  Remarks By The President To Employees Of General Motors
nonapplause We cannot build a security policy that is only based on defense and is not about winning the battle of hearts and minds and ideas.
nonapplause I spent quite a bit of time thinking about what I would say in my couple of minutes.
nonapplause The pictures of that brave venture are etched on our memory and our inability to help remains a burden on the conscience of the free world.
nonapplause We've achieved a great deal over these last few years.
nonapplause That was in grade school  I still remember.
nonapplause I strongly supported it.
nonapplause This has allowed us  among other things  to pass pension protection legislation that has strengthened the pension protection for 40 million Americans  to put 25 years on the life of Medicare for the first time in 25 years.
nonapplause I think that we saw further evidence of that  by the way  in the way they went about handling this Elian Gonzalez thing.
nonapplause Madam Chairman  Nancy  and I want you ladies to know that she isn't really that much taller than me; they've taken the box away that she was standing on.
nonapplause He found ways to encourage new technologies  promote safety  protect the environment.
nonapplause It's a nightmare for people who have to depend on the government to get theirs when not all the providers will cover Medicaid.
nonapplause We're reminded of that again in Topeka on Monday in celebration of Brown Vs. Board of Education  the 50th anniversary  and I mention this not to wallow in nostalgia  but to remind the young people in today's audience that there really was a time in Washington when political differences didn't get in the way of personal friendships  which brings us to the political odd couple you see before you.
nonapplause When it does  President Bush and I will run hard and take nothing for granted.
nonapplause Each stop of this trip is important  but among them all  this moment occupies a special place in my heart and in the hearts of my countrymen -- a moment of kinship and homecoming in these hallowed halls.
nonapplause Because half or more of our people are still working harder without a raise.
