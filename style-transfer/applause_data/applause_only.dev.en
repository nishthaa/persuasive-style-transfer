applause And perhaps most important  we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values.
applause I want to thank you for your hard work and for your strong support.
applause You see  a free and peaceful Iraq and a free and peaceful Afghanistan will be powerful examples to a neighborhood that needs the example of liberty.
applause And so  even though they didn't have much  they scrounged around and raised some money and wrote a letter to Booker T. Washington  asking him to send a teacher to help build a school in the piney woods.
applause Then you have to decide.
applause But  my friends  consider what a President must do.
applause You know  thus far in the campaign we haven't heard much in the way of strategies from the other side to win the war on terror  or to expand our economy.
applause And while that exposes us to an unprecedented array of opinions  analysis  and points of view  it also makes it that much more important that we're all operating on a common baseline of facts.
applause Christmas is a season of glad tidings  and a time when our thoughts turn to the source of joy and hope born in a humble manger 2000 years ago.
applause I want to thank you all for coming.
applause Let's value child-rearing and education.
applause Just a couple of years ago in Baltimore -- where the mayor has labored mightily on this -- there was this wonderful young man  17 years old  his whole life before him; took two little kids out trick-or-treating so they would be safe.

applause Please be seated.
applause The prospect of a resolution actually offers us the chance to integrate the world  to make the United Nations a more meaningful  more powerful  more effective institution.
applause But in some places in America  it's a different story.
applause And as I think of the issue at hand today  I think of a verse from the Old Testament  the prophet Ezekiel  22:30  "God said  'And I sought for a man among them  that they should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it  but I found none."
applause We're living in a new and different time where we've got to try.
applause We have been criticized because the argument has been made that we are downgrading the United States.
applause Around the country  President Bush and I meet with their families.
applause We know we have more work to do to make sure that every person that wants to work in America can find a job.
applause God bless.
applause This is a matter of national security just as much as the national security issues beyond our borders on which we try to achieve a bipartisan consensus.
applause I thank you for that.
applause And I say that one of the major differences between where our opponents stand and we stand is that they say: Send your money to Washington and we will spend it for you.
applause On vital matters of national security  Senator Kerry offers a record of weakness and a strategy of retreat.
applause But slowly  interest grew.

applause Thank you  Adam.
applause You've seen the face of it.
applause It means also - it means also waging the battle for peace with the same determination and dedication that you wage a battle to win the war  and that means fighting for freedom  not just to keep it for ourselves because that isn't enough  but to expand it for the people throughout the world.
applause to keep the President's sensible  mainstream nominees off the bench.
applause It helped us to become more economically  environmentally and energy secure.
applause We do not fool Mr. Khrushchev.
applause Now it is 8 years later.
applause They went on to slaughter the Miskito Indians by the thousands  abuse and deport church leaders  slander the Pope  and move to kill free speech  and practiced anti-Semitism.
applause It reminds me of one of the wisest decisions that President Roosevelt made after World War II  and that was to give every returning soldier the chance to go on to college through the G.I.
applause Your future is limitless and you have done a great job for the people of this state.
applause Thank you very much.
applause And then  of course  you've got the big man  Shaq.
applause Now  this is all -- this is all just domestically.
applause There never can be a time when terrorism is just a nuisance.

applause Oh  he is going back.
applause When President Bush and I stood on the inaugural platform on the west side of the Capitol and took the oath of office  our economy was sliding into recession.
applause You can tell we're friends -- you can't make fun of your enemies.
applause There will always be people who  for one reason or another  have a rough spot in life.
applause I believe the issue is very clear  and the issue is whether the American people are satisfied with things as they are  whether they feel that the 1960's are a time to really conserve and stand still and gather our energy  or whether the 1960's are a time to move forward again  as 1932 was  as 1912 was.
applause Today we honor another good man.
applause The home ownership rate is at the highest ever.

applause And it has brought us three years in a row of reducing the federal deficit  for the first time since Harry Truman was President of the United States.
applause I'm honored to be with all of you  and I bring greetings to you from the President.
applause We have no illusions about the nature of this struggle  or the character of the enemy we face.
applause I remember paying you a visit during the campaign.
applause Remember: Don't just work for the can-didate for the Presidency  but work for all of them  because it's that kind of team operation that makes responsible government and a two-party system possible.
applause For example  one of them was a jeweler and he told me  he said  I sold dinars to buy -- I think he said euros -- to buy gold so I could make a watch.
applause And I believe someone who commits a violent crime at 17 should not be able to turn around and buy a gun for a birthday present at 21.
applause I have a better idea.
applause What an honor it is to represent you all  and what an honor it is to be the President of the greatest country on the face of the earth.
applause One reason why we are successful as a party is because we've got a great party chairman who understands that our message is one that should reach into every neighborhood; ours is one that is inclusive; ours is one that is hopeful  and that's Ken Mehlman.

applause That was of some modest benefit to me at the time.
applause In the budget I submitted to the Congress  we pay down debt by $2 trillion.

applause Would I think about running for President  and I look at them and figure I should go lie down for awhile and let it go away.
applause We're helping to rebuild Iraq  where the dictator built palaces for himself  instead of hospitals and schools.
applause It is now time for both Houses to come together and to get a good bill to my desk as soon as possible.
applause That money would provide a nest egg to supplement their traditional Social Security checks  a nest egg they would call their own  a nest egg the government could not take away  and a nest egg they could pass on to their children.

applause I want you to remember what happened in the 2000 campaign.
applause Lieutenant Governor Parker could not be here  but I can see there is his sign up there and certainly after the splendid administration of Harold Handley  we're going to continue Indiana in the Republican tradition in the State House in Indianapolis by voting for him.

applause You are terrific.
applause The quality of judgment to be able to pick from five or six possible solutions in a crisis which affects the security of the United States  experience and judgment  but the second quality which is equally important is the quality of foresight.

applause I honestly believe the best days of this country lie before us.
applause If you look at the last 20 months  this Congress -- I might add without one single  solitary vote from a member of the other party -- the Democrats who were so often attacked as being for big government and spending voted for a budget that cut $255 billion in federal spending; that reduced the deficit by more than any plan ever adopted in the history of the country; that gave us three years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was president; that did it --   I might add  they did it by raising tax rates on only the top 1.2 percent of Americans  including most of you in this room tonight.

applause Two people of Italian heritage  I might add: The Governor --   -- and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
applause That's what this plan will do for you.
applause The bill is stuck in the United States Senate.
applause Roslyn Brock  who is the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors for the NAACP.
applause It's now time for both Houses to iron out their differences and to get a bill to my desk as soon as possible  so that we can say to our seniors of today and those of us who are going to be seniors tomorrow  we have kept our commitment in Washington  D.C.
applause We stand for progress and I cannot believe  in this vital State of Oklahoma  that any citizen of this State  looking at Oklahoma and the Nation  can come to any other conclusion but this country and this State must move forward in the 1960's.
applause Perhaps there were those who wanted to write you off  maybe because of assumptions they made about you or your school or your community.
applause Mr. President  when I think of the successes of the past eight years I don't think so much of the programs and legislation as I think of the people and the communities that have been changed and helped by what you have done.
applause A matter of fact  if you go to the Tenth Amendment in the Constitution  what does it tell you?
applause But it will apply to those who use those foreign locations to export products back to the United States or to other nations.
applause But now is exactly the wrong time to be raising taxes just as we've come out of recession.
applause As I travel our country  I remind our citizens there are thousands of people working as hard as they possibly can to keep America safe.
applause He's a perfect fit for his constituents  a great representative in Washington.
applause The trouble was  he would play the wrong tunes and go his own way at rehearsals  so no wonder they're trying to keep him off the bandstand until the concert is over.
applause A shining example of how AmeriCorps alums go on to do great things.
applause Already  we have closed or turned over to Iraq hundreds of bases.
applause We'll protect this country by going on the offensive  and by taking the fight to the enemy.
applause She knows whose side she's on.
applause But as the new President turns to meet these old problems  new pressures will rush upon him  new crises from every section of the world  new decisions on weapons  on strategy  on economic policy  and a thousand other items.
applause And I know that it has been a major emphasis of President Fox to get micro-credits to the Mexican people and the United States is very proud to be a part of this wonderful effort which provides technical assistance  which is providing for the establishment of more centers where people can come in and get advice or they can come and get their money so that they can begin.
applause We should be facing the challenges of the baby-boom retirement.
applause So every time you think about the good things that I have been able to achieve  if a law was required and a change was required  I can tell you that if it hadn't been for those two men sharing the same values  the same hopes  the same dreams and being willing to pay the same heat it would not have happened.
applause We got interest rates down so we can grow the economy.
applause Your mandate was important 20 years ago; it is equally important today.
applause I don't want -- when these folks start running the okeedoke on you  I want you to be clear.
applause Our commanders are patient; they're not restless.
applause Give them a big round of applause.
applause And I don't know anybody my age or younger that hasn't had some conflict between work and patenting.
applause So I just want to thank both Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg not only for being here today  but for your extraordinary service on the Court.
applause I especially want to recognize the tradition of service to community and country that is fostered here.
applause He proved that there was life after Washington.
applause Are you willing to tolerate the occasional mistake of a government that is transforming itself radically in order to know that somebody is there looking out for the public interest and our obligations to one another as a community.
applause I want you to remember this -- I'll send a copy of this to Mr. Whitehead and he can send it out.
applause I've seen hate on the faces of too many Klansmen and too many White Citizens Councilors in the South to want to hate  myself  because every time I see it  I know that it does something to their faces and their personalities  and I say to myself that hate is too great a burden to bear.
applause And  after all  that's not only important for good economic policy  that's important to make sure America fulfills its promise for everybody who is fortunate enough to live here.
applause So let me end by saying  may God bless you all  and may God protect out troops.
applause He has a wonderful story.
applause That's important.
applause You don't know how heartwarming that is to just come back from Iran and be greeted like that.
applause When America led a coalition to enforce the demands of a free world and to end the regime of Saddam Hussein  the Marines of Camp Pendleton made us proud once again.
applause May I also take this occasion to thank you and the Canadian people for the outstanding hospitality which you have shown to me and to your many visitors from abroad during the past twelve months.
applause It can be done  it will be done  and we intend to make a start on the 4th May.
applause And this is the secret of America's strength.
applause There has been no greater Vice President for the United States of America than Dick Cheney.
applause Support human rights; we believe in that.
applause He is trying to hide it  to cover it up by using a little tough talk during the course of this campaign.
applause We passed class-action reform.
applause The Senator has finally apologized  and rightfully so.
applause Having removed a dictator  our coalition is working with Iraqi leaders toward the same goal: a democratic country that can defend itself  that will not be a safe haven for terrorists  and that will be a model for freedom in a troubled part of the world.
applause President Bush met with Iraqi's new leader  Prime Minister Allawi  at the White House recently.
applause God bless Tom.
applause I thought you signalled that from your applause.
applause And I want to congratulate Jane Ring  who spoke to you earlier  who was the Teacher of the Year in her neighborhood.
applause The first prerequisite of any agenda that seeks to limit the power of government  that seeks to respect the responsibility and authority of parents for the schooling of their children  of workers of the spending for their own hard earned dollars--all these things that involve us in the fight for our own rights and choices and liberty are grounded on this: that we must restore the moral basis of our own self-control and moral self-respect  because without it  we will surrender all our liberties.
applause We didn't ask for this global struggle  but we are answering history's call with confidence and a comprehensive strategy.
applause That's why I was in Mile High Stadium.
applause So I don't think we're moving too fast.
applause He has been moving outward and he has done it by unrelenting effort to demonstrate that his society represents the way to the future.
applause U.S. law enforcement has documented cases of Latvian girls trafficked into sexual slavery in Chicago  or Ukrainian girls trafficked in Los Angeles  and Maryland  or Thai  Korean  Malaysian and Vietnamese girls trafficked in Georgia  or and Mexican girls trafficked in California  New Jersey and here in Florida.
applause I want to thank you all for coming to join us.
applause You can even offer to drive a friend or a neighbor to the polls.
applause They came  not to welcome a visiting President  but to light candles  to sing hymns  to pray for an end to tyranny and the restoration of religious liberty.
applause When Hillary was making her remarks I was looking at her  imagining her here  thinking about the first time I ever came to Chicago to see my wife  before we were married.
applause He was terrific.
applause Now it's a time for good public policy.
applause It's unthinkable now  isn't it?
applause And for those of you who have got a loved one in the United States military  I want to say two things to you: one  we'll make sure your loved one has whatever is necessary to protect America; and  secondly  thank you for their sacrifice.
applause Well  I appreciated being introduced as a grandmother.
applause People do better at work if they know they're doing right by their kids at home.
applause This unswerving commitment of our American friends -- to this we owe our thanks for the fact that the wall  the barbed wire  that divided Berlin for such a long time could finally be overcome.
applause You make all of us proud to be Americans.
applause We have expanded Head Start  created the national service program  given our schools the tools they need to meet higher standards.
applause Because of what you did  we cut taxes for small businesses and 95 percent of working Americans just as we said we would.
applause It's really been a four-year journey for these guys.
applause And by the way  it's reform that begins to bring down costs for families and businesses and governments.
applause Already  an Iraqi independent electoral commission is up and running and political parties are planning campaigns.
applause And finally  when they reached an impasse in Louisiana  Father Ted flew them all to Notre Dame's retreat in Land O'Lakes  Wisconsin --   -- where they eventually overcame their differences and hammered out a final deal.
applause That is what this is about.
applause This is a great State.
applause And the second thing I want to thank you for is when 800 of you showed up on the White House lawn during a rather difficult time for me --   -- and said that the Irish American community still thought that I should serve as President of the United States  which I will never forget.
applause Mr. President  your passion to make the lives of ordinary Americans better has been on display.
applause That means 700 more good middle class jobs and strong families; 700 more Americans with a success story to tell.
applause And I have watched him  and I wanted him to do this job because I don't think our country has a stronger voice of the values  the ideas of the Democratic Party  and because he's not afraid to fight.
applause Thank you.
applause And that means it's important--we dare not turn back on a strategy that's working.
applause Dick Nixon has been in bed for 4 hours.
applause But we all know  too  we can do all these things -- put our economic house in order  expand world trade  target the jobs of the future  guarantee equal opportunity -- but if we're honest  we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education  training and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow.
applause That's why we're working to build a trading system that upholds the rights of workers and consumers  and helps us and them in other countries to protect the environment  so that competition among nations is a race to the top  not the bottom.
applause I've known him since he was digging ditches at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo Grounds  just outside our hometown.
applause So  as the President of the United States  I want to tell you plain and simple  the American people respect you  they appreciate you  and I'll do everything in my power to make sure the families and those who wear the uniform have all the support necessary to win this war on terror.
applause The fact of the matter is that the election of 1960 is 2 months from tonight  and I think that 2 months from tonight the Democratic Party is going to regain the Chief Executive Office.
applause The President and I know better than that.
applause Here's the really good news: If we maintain our resolve  we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.
applause And even though they were about my age  they told me they were celebrating their first anniversary.
applause Give him a big round of applause.
applause Dr. Condoleezza Rice advises the President on foreign policy and Margaret Spellings is in charge of domestic policy.
applause But we have to do more.
applause I'd like to say a special word of thanks to all the staff people who worked on this  but especially to David Hoppe  Senator Lott's chief of staff  who did such a fine job here.
applause Excuse me.
applause Well  let me say this: I'm getting tired of hearing people run down the United States of America.
applause But I want members of Congress to remember this fact about our tax code and about our economy and about the American Dream.
applause Now  we've recovered most of your money already  but I don't think "most of your money" is good enough.
applause New home construction is at the highest level in almost 20 years.
applause You have made a difference  and we do all applaud you.

applause But it was quality.
applause Mr. Speaker  I appreciate you coming.
applause Yesterday  President Karzai of Afghanistan came to the White House and to the U.S. Capitol  and thanked the American people for helping to free his country and for being a friend to the Afghan people.
applause That's what this is all about.
applause Weve been through a lot together these last four years.
applause One of our new governors here  Governor Davis  while he is governor -- while he is governor -- may preside over a state that has no majority race.
applause He said that we were warmongers; said that we had them ringed with bases; he attacked our economy; he attacked everything we stood for.
applause Thank you  Prague.
applause As Jim knows  to bring health care costs under control for families and small business owners  we need medical liability reform.
applause Do you believe as an American citizen of this State and country that we can be led by a political party  the Republicans  who have stood still  who have opposed progress at every turn?
applause There'll be a democratically elected government in place in Afghanistan by the end of the year.
applause Let's go.
applause This is my mommy.
applause If that is what you want  you can have him.
applause He also understands that we must have certainty in the tax code.
applause But a President -- a President -- always casts the deciding vote.
applause They were wrong.
applause And that's good news for America.
applause And both Houses should reach agreement on my faith-based initiative to support the armies of compassion that are mentoring children  caring for the homeless  and offering hope to the addicted.
applause If we had started the environmentally safe development of ANWR in Alaska 15 years ago  when it was first proposed  that oil would now be arriving by pipeline at the rate of up to a million barrels a day.
applause I wish you all the best for the -- whatever the future may hold.
applause You know -- yeah  you can clap for that.
applause The government must allow for workers to be able to organize in unions outside of the control of the government.
applause I realize that on July 4  you had the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.
applause You already heard from one -- please give it up for Governor Tim Kaine.
applause You know  it's hard to think of anything an American could do that didn't kill a lot of people that would offend our sense of decency more than burning a house of worship.
applause Many Americans still haven't felt the impact of what we've done.
applause He's helped bring accountability to our classrooms through his support of the No Child Left Behind Act.
applause Mirta  will you stand up and take a bow?
applause All of us who serve this country have important responsibilities.
applause Thank you.
applause The terrorists are on the run  with good reason to fear what the night might bring.
applause We will give leadership if we are successful  and I can promise you this country will start to move again.
applause A young lady leapt out onto the stage and started singing.
applause And recently --   -- and recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary.
applause I feel that this campaign has an opportunity to render a service and that is that when the campaign is over  in my judgment  the American people will have made their choice  and their choice will be progress.
applause Thank you very much.
applause Patty was one of the people who took the lead in that critical change.
applause We know that America's $10 trillion economy is sustained by the free enterprise system  and by the hard work of the nation's entrepreneurs and workers.
applause In the war  America depends on our military to meet the dangers abroad and to keep our country safe.
applause Yes.
applause And I want to say a special word of thanks to Pat Milkovich for the wonderful tour of the training center today  we had a great time and I thank you so much.
applause Now  if we develop new engines  new fuel cells  and new fuels  it will save the automobile industry in Michigan  not destroy it.
applause And I still recall his dedication and high standards of learning.
applause That's what this guy will do.
applause That was a great introduction  and it's nice to be back in Savannah -- although  actually  I guess  we're in Pooler  Georgia  I'm told.
applause Again  in Wyoming  we've got a slightly different situation because we're a public land state.
applause Thank you and God bless you all.
applause The people of West Virginia have always answered the call to military service.
applause But it did  as the Vice President said  cost several members of Congress their jobs.
applause There is a bulge in the population.
applause Speaking of sports  I want to take a moment of personal privilege to offer my very best wishes on his retirement to your distinguished basketball coach  Judd Heathcote.
applause I'm anxious to see him in the White House.
applause This is about America's future.
applause And it is surely in Israel's interest to deal with Palestinians in a way that permits them to feel a sense of dignity instead of despair.
applause So they continued to wage those attacks -- making the world less safe and eventually striking us here at home on 9/11.
applause Well  I'm going to repeat it again.
applause We need to do what's right  not what's political  and we need to do it right now.
applause That's a tax cut we can pay for and a tax cut that will pay for itself many times over.
applause I could not disagree more.
applause But working together we have  I am convinced  come to solutions that are best for our nation's health and for our nation's economy.
applause Their plan expanded the deficit.
applause That was true in World War II when that old Jeep was made.
applause Thank you  and God bless you.
applause I come today as a candidate for the office of the Presidency  who lives in Massachusetts  who is a Senator from Massachusetts  but who runs as a candidate for a united national Democratic Party.
applause If you are fortunate enough to be a mother or a father  you're responsible for loving your child with all your heart.
applause So I just wanted to let you know you did fabulously.
applause Out of that determination  Grambling has truly grown into a university for the 21st century.
applause The designs  the uranium  the centrifuges now reside down at a U.S. facility in Oak Ridge  Tennessee.
applause But this was not the year to do it.
applause She's got a track record of doing so.
applause What are the things the American Government  the American President  the American people must support if we are to keep the peace without surrender and extend freedom?
applause I got cancer and I had to take some time off and deal with it  and my husband had to take some time off and work with me.
applause In a real sense  it is not merely a contest between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.
applause We've been tested.
applause The judge says  Judge Moore  that you have been breaking the law.
applause The Big Three automakers report their exports are up 500 percent to Mexico.
applause And we -- it had a huge impact on our lives.

applause And I told you then that if we wanted to steer ourselves out of our economic crisis  if we wanted to bring about the change we needed  then I needed your help.
applause Because we are strong and resolute  Iraq will never go back to the camp of tyranny and terror.
applause Hello  Miami!
applause And we have some folks on the Supreme Court who believe in the Constitution.
applause I want to thank all the National Park Service employees for their hard work.
applause Our military not only proved themselves on a battlefield  but our military were liberators  freeing women and children  giving them the chance to breathe the fresh air of freedom.
applause You can move money anywhere in the flash of an eye.
applause That's worth clapping for.
applause You are showing the commitment of our nation: We will work tirelessly to disrupt and prevent terrorist attacks -- and if an attack should come  America will be prepared.
applause And yet with each test  the American people have displayed the true character of our nation.
applause We thank you.
applause There he is.
applause And Ernie is not going to play politics with your money.
applause Senator  who succeeded Tom Hennings  and who I know you will elect to the Senate in November  John Dalton  who will be the next Governor of the State of Missouri   Tom Eagleton  who is the candidate of the Democratic Party and I  hope the next attorney general of the State of Missouri  ladies and gentlemen  I come here as the Democratic standard bearer and you must make your decision on November 8 about the kind of State you want and the kind of district you want and the kind of town you want and the kind of country you want and the kind of world you want.
applause I am delighted to be here with all these Democrats behind me  and especially with our Democratic gubernatorial nominee  John Marty -- thank you for coming.
applause Thank you.
applause As we meet  ladies and gentlemen  General Petraeus and his troops are in the midst of some extremely tough  intense and dangerous work.
applause Those regimes chose defiance  and those regimes are no more.
applause But today's election makes me nostalgic.
applause I am ready to give it to you.
applause I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years.
applause And as the President has said many times  and no one should doubt it  "We will finish what we have begun  and we will win this essential victory in the war on terror."
applause He spoke with clarity.
applause A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation.
applause And of course  I could not come here without sending my greetings and gratitude to the citizens of Obama  Japan.
applause May God bless America.
applause You know what I'm talking about.
applause He always used to say in America we want a better life for our children than we have had for ourselves - and that's what we want  and that's what we're going to get  but we're going to get in  in my opinion  by building on the tremendous progress we have had under Dwight D. Eisenhower.
applause Do you want to balance the budget in a way that protects our obligations to the elderly  to families with members with disabilities  to our poorest children  to protect the environment  to invest in eduction  to grow the economy and keep interest rates down?
applause Competition is better for the consumer than State control.
applause It's a reminder that we're engaged in a global war on terror.
applause I want to thank Tom Herald  who is the faculty senate president.
applause In the House  162 Democrats -- nearly 80 percent  voted no.

applause Appreciate the members of the Cabinet who are here  members of Congress  members of the Armed Forces.
applause Some members of the Senate are trying to keep nominees off the bench by blocking up or down votes.

applause People from all faiths -- Christian  Jewish  Muslim  Hindu -- have heard a universal call.
applause I'm proud of my husband for recognizing the challenges America faces at home and abroad  and for taking action to meet them.
applause Greg talked about my understanding of the need to develop renewable sources of energy.
applause But the point is  I get the chance to observe senators in action because I do spend a fair amount of time up there.
applause And why?
applause That's what they said yes to  and then we had our chance and we said  no.
applause And I urge everyone of you  if you believe in these candidates  work just as hard for them as you do for me.
applause We will work for medical liability reform.
applause I do.
applause Thank you  and God bless you.
applause And I put out a faith-based initiative because I want the great strength of the country  the heart and soul of the American people to rally to the cause of those who hurt.
applause It's pretty clear that the terrorists who attacked us did not understand the strength and resilience of this country.
applause Kids  don't you think this is cool?
applause In Basra  British forces and Iraqis have formed joint patrols to maintain order.
applause But it's a little much when Andy shows up on the day of the Clemson game dressed as "Cocky."
applause We are going to release $96 million to help create affordable housing here in New York through the innovative Home Program  the same HUD program that helped to stimulate the revitalization we're celebrating today.
applause Kids ought to be in school  not on the street during school hours  I think.
applause That's what all the law enforcement people know.
applause In our nation the welfare rolls are down  the food stamp rolls are down  the poverty rate is down  and the teen pregnancy rate is down now for two years in a row.

applause I hear the College Republicans here give the best party on campus.
applause Dr.
applause And we will help if they will do that.
applause So I can't speak in the Senate  but I am allowed to preside and to cast those tie-breaking votes -- but also to work very closely with two absolutely outstanding senators in John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison.
applause But I believe that Indiana and the rest of the United States are going to choose in 1960 to look forward again  to put their confidence in the Democratic Party which  in other days in other years  in other crises  has produced leadership and has moved this country off dead center.
applause Thank you all.
applause This nation is determined.
applause We just don't deal with people who are different from us.
applause I like to tell folks that Lynne and I have a marriage that came about as the result of a great Republican victory in a presidential campaign in 1952.
applause For those families  we will take the White House in November of this year.
applause And one of the best reasons why is to keep Laura as the First Lady for four years.
applause Thanks for letting me come by to say hello.
applause And citizenship is grounded on the principles of the Declaration  and the principles of the Declaration say that we have rights as citizens because they come from the hand of God.
applause I want you to know what's happened here.
applause We're improving coordination on the ground  and modernizing emergency communications  helping families plan for a crisis.
applause In short  America knows there is more work to do -- but we are meeting our responsibility  and will continue to do so.
applause And that's making America as safe as possible from terrorist attack.
applause Jim and I served together in the House before he achieved exalted rank as a member of the United States Senate.
applause I don't know whether you'd be interested in knowing where that came from.
applause The Declaration says it.
applause And then there were corporate scandals and war  all of which affected the people's confidence.
applause Congratulations on the success of this league and the inspiration it provides to young women everywhere.
applause It's good to see a number of hardworking correspondents here tonight.
applause One of the reasons that people don't leave welfare has nothing to do with the welfare check  it's because if you stay on welfare the government will pay for your children's health care.
applause I want to tell you --   -- there is something bigger though than just a legislative agenda at hand.
applause I'm grateful for that.
applause At least  he said that yesterday  and he also said the party did matter in an earlier speech.
applause I also believe we have to do more for shelter.
applause And they're giving away bikes to families.
applause The lessons of September the 11th are lessons we must not forget.
applause I cannot believe that a country which is faced by so many challenges at home and abroad cannot meet the problem of full employment so that our people can find work when they want it.
applause There will be no passing that way once a Conservative Government is again in office.
applause Twenty-seven thousand men and women in this state are working today because of what Harry Reid did.
applause So I am very grateful to him.
applause If he were here today  I believe he would be proud that this administration has appointed more black  more Hispanic  more Asian Americans  more Native Americans to Cabinet positions  and judgeships and other high posts --   -- than ever before in American history.
applause They're here somewhere over there.
applause Americans today have more money to spend  to save  and invest  and they are using it to drive this economy forward.
applause And I'm pleased that this week  right here in Iowa  President Bush signed a bill extending tax relief  so families and small businesses can stay on the path to greater prosperity.
applause It's going to take time.
applause And that is why  for the sake of our children and our grandchildren  the terrorists will be defeated.
applause We commit ourselves to a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour.
applause Good morning  everybody  and welcome to the White House.
applause Margaret Spellings is in charge of domestic issues.
applause Under these rules  they won't be able to do that anymore.
applause I've seen their great decency and the unselfish courage of those who wear our uniform.
applause I ask your help in this campaign.
applause We will protect Medicare  so it's a safety net for our seniors that they can count on today  tomorrow  forever.
applause This enemy  in the words of the 9/11 Commission's report released last week  is "sophisticated  patient  disciplined  and lethal."
applause Under President Bush's leadership  we will use America's great power to serve great purposes  to protect our homeland by turning back and defeating the forces of terror  and spreading hope and freedom around the world.
applause We need effective legal reform.
applause And his job that summer when I first knew him was sweeping out the Ben Franklin store in our hometown  in Casper  Wyoming.
applause Now  if he couldn't stand up to the pressure of Howard Dean  how can we expect him to stand up to Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda organization?
applause President Bush and I will also continue to defend our society's fundamental rights and values.
applause He'll stand with the men and women who wear the uniform  who patrol your highway  who work in the neighborhood to keep the people of this Commonwealth safe.
applause When I travel overseas  time and again they say to me  "Strikes.
applause Since 2001  real after-tax incomes have increased by 11 percent.
applause And when members of Congress speak not of victory  but of time limits --   -- when members speak not of victory but of time limits  deadlines or other arbitrary measures  they're telling the enemy simply to watch the clock and wait us out.
applause Arne Duncan.
applause At least  that's how they were rated by those who know something about women's lacrosse.
applause Some of you were here.
applause Well  thank you.
applause That's the only reason she did it.
applause Of course we welcome the growth of private health insurance.
applause And you know on the way over here  we had to make a stop at Johnny Moore's Bass Pro Shops.
applause Of course  he also said  "Perhaps the editor might divide his paper into four chapters  heading the first 'truths'; second  'probabilities'; third  'possibilities'; fourth  'lies'."
applause The future of the children here depend upon our success in this effort.
applause Like you -- yes  you married well.
applause It doesn't matter whether I vote.
applause This has been the most rewarding thing  I think  in many ways I've been able to do as President.
applause She is tall  she is beautiful  she got up in my arms  and she said  Mr. President  I can give myself my own shots now  I'm doing well in school and I'm doing well.
applause And that's what our health care system should let you be.
applause It also cuts taxes on 15 to 16 million working families who work 40 hours a week  have kids in their house and are barely above the poverty line  so they'll be working and not on welfare.
applause Dr. Brown  Melissa Brown  has dedicated her life to serving others through medicine and education  and she'll be a very effective public servant in Washington  D.C.
applause I've got a simple question.
applause It's not a good deal for the American people.
applause People of the country are getting to know what the people of Wisconsin already know  is that if you give a man a tough job  he can handle it  and I appreciate your leadership.
applause Sacrifice a little bit for a greater good.
applause I appreciate this second night performance very much.

applause But  my friends  whether it's education  whether it's science  whether it's economic development  you can be sure their society is behind us now  and it will never catch us if we remain true to our principles and don't turn their way  rather than our way.
applause Why?
applause And so I want to just say two things that aren't particularly sophisticated.
applause Topeka was always the place for making history.
applause I doubt very seriously that I'd be standing here as President of the United States tonight if it hadn't been for Ron Brown.
applause It is a moral disgrace.
applause When we fail to invest in research  we fail to invest in the future.
applause We banned torture.
applause There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction -- but no longer without attention and without consequence.
applause When I first came to Washington  I said  you know  this is a state issue.
applause We passed budget agreements to help maintain spending discipline in Washington  D.C. On issue after issue  this administration has acted on principle  has kept its word and has made progress for the American people.
applause It is great to be here at the Columbia Heights Educational Campus.

applause Anyone who seeks to harm our soldiers can know that our soldiers are hunting for them.

applause Repeal the Sixteenth Amendment  abolish the income tax  and return the original Constitution of our freedom.
applause If anybody told me that all these ideas that I talked so passionately about in the campaign of '92  that I thought would work because they were beginning to work in Arkansas  I would have said  I'll take that right now.

applause As we like to say in Wyoming  you can put all the lipstick you want on that pig  but at the end of the day it's still a pig.
applause -- be fired up and be ready to go --   -- because Barbara Boxer is ready to go!
applause But  Mr Chairman  having dealt both on some of the social services and on some of the economic side  you and I will agree that even if you get all the economics right there is still a lot else to do.
applause As I said before  without you  we would not be here  because all of you were here in the beginning when it was hard.
applause I'm glad you're letting me talk today.

applause And now 50 years -- 60 years later  the two sons who are Prime Minister and President are best of friends  and our countries have a very  very strong alliance.

applause They have traveled  I understand  from all across the country to be with us.
applause The world was right to confront the regime of Saddam Hussein  and we were right to end the regime of Saddam Hussein.
applause This thing is tight  and it is tight partly because things are going well and it's easy to blur the distinctions.
applause I will not abandon their views  I will not abandon their heart  and I will not abandon the field and leave them with no choice whatsoever.
applause And how many would like a proposal that brings down costs for everyone?
applause Even the ones that can't make it  really want to and wish they could.

applause The administration and the Republican Congress are pro-growth and pro-jobs.
applause In the last five years  the Bush tax relief has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers  investors  small businesses  and families.
applause We must vote for the best man  whether he was a Democrat or a Republican.
applause And I think they all deserve a round of applause.

applause The Mayor and I share something in common -- we're both problem solvers.

applause Looking to next year  to November of 2004  we've got a very busy year ahead of us.
applause And facing serious challenges requires serious leaders -– leaders who are willing to take on the status quo; leaders who are willing to take on special interests; leaders who are willing to fight for our people and our future.

applause Thank you very much.
applause But let me just say to you  if you care about this and you want what I want  you want poor people to have the same life that everybody else has -- having a chance to succeed at home and at work -- then let's say to everyone in America without regard to party  let's don't let welfare reform be a fraud.

applause Each of these events was dramatic in its own way.
applause They don't often mention Herbert Hoover  and they can't mention Theodore Roosevelt  because he left the party in 1912.
applause And because higher education is a dream for so many people  he'll make Pell grants available -- more Pell grants available so that many more Americans can earn a college diploma.
applause As long as the waving symbol of one American's pride is the shameful symbol of another American's pain  we have another bridge to cross.

applause Mad Dog.
applause The President and I are tremendously grateful for all the support we've got here in Iowa.
applause Our families won't be secure until fathers and mothers begin to realize that they have to put their children first.

applause But the presidency is an entirely different proposition.
applause One of the most important commitments that George Bush and I made during the 2000 campaign was that our armed forces would have the resources they need and the respect they deserve -- and we have kept our word to the U.S. military.

applause I can't see for these spotlights  so if I'm looking in the wrong direction  that's the reason.
applause Under the President's leadership  we removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and closed down the camps where those terrorists trained to kill Americans.

applause Those are all facts.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause An economy where you can make a living and care for your families.
applause I've had some of my happiest days as a candidate and as a President in this part of the wonderful state of California.
applause And we've seen it in the daily courage of the Mongolian people who claimed their freedom 15 years ago  and are now standing with others across the world to help them do the same.
applause As those forces gain strength and experience  and as the political process advances  we'll be able to decrease troop levels without losing our capacity to defeat the terrorists.
applause We're going to make mistakes and they're going to make mistakes.
applause We will make renewable energy the profitable kind of energy.
applause In other words  it was a team effort that got these men here to the White House.
applause The United States Patent Office also had its doubts.
applause And we believe every school should teach those basics.
applause In the United States of America  the terrorists have chosen a foe unlike they have any -- they have never faced before.
applause So here's my attitude and my message to the people in Washington  D.C.
applause We're calling other nations to help Iraq build a free country  which will make us all more secure.
applause Mr. Diamond.
applause Yes  let us build our bridge.
applause It will revolutionize their performance later on.
applause We ought to go back there and say  look  we've agreed on enough money to balance the budget  we've agreed we can provide at least a modest tax cut to people for child rearing and education  we can help small business some with their pensions and with some other things -- let's get after it and do it and get it behind us and then go on and do politics.
applause And she said -- it's a true story -- and she said  and I met this wonderful man.
applause And because of these qualities  Ronald Reagan changed the course of history as few men have ever done.
applause I want to thank Brad James  the head coach  and Joel Maturi  who is the athletic director  for coming.
applause I guess the best way to summarize me is I came from Texas and I'm going back to Texas with the exact same values I had when I arrived in Washington  D.C.
applause It is nothing more than an international commitment to doing what we're trying to do here with the New Markets agenda and with the empowerment zones.
applause I like that a lot.
applause Thank you very much.
applause Here in Washington  we have to stay focused on the needs of the country.
applause Before I ask you to do the best you can in your house  I ought to make sure I'm doing the best I can in my house.
applause I think they will here in the Bronx.
applause I like men too but don't misunderstand me  they always showed up for the head table  but they never showed up for work  and if I wanted to get elected  I went to the women.
applause And we want our seniors to share in the benefits of that system.
applause Yo-Yo Ma.
applause I have to thank our extraordinary Secretary of Health and Human Services  Kathleen Sebelius  for taking the time to be here.
applause I see Edwin Moses and Sonny Walker out there; and those of us who are your fans  Mr. Fishburne  are glad to see you here.
applause And that's why I know that you are going to make sure that Barbara Boxer gets another six years in the United States Senate.
applause To help young mothers  who had babies  to move into second change homes  and to support both education and work benefits for people who didn't have much of either.
applause We know -- we know as you do that your task is enormous.
applause Mayor Corning  Congressman O'Brien Mrs. Price  ladies and gentlemen  and fellow Government employees.
applause They are.
applause Yeah  it's true.
applause We are moving very rapidly in all forms of production and service to a knowledge-based economy in which what you earn depends on what you can learn.

applause And now  while I'm on this subject  I wonder whether I could enlist your help.
applause We don't believe in conscription  this meeting tonight being a living proof.
applause They cry for you  and they hurt for you.
applause We still face serious challenges on the ground in Iraq.
applause We believe it's your money  your money  and you ought to be able to determine how it's spent and not the federal government.
applause I also want to say a special word of acknowledgement and appreciation to Joan Mondale  who is here with us today and who I believe will also be an outstanding ambassador for the United States in Japan.
applause We have spoken openly and directly about the fundamental moral differences between the United States and the Soviet Union.
applause We're proud of it.
applause But Utah stood out.
applause That glue that holds it all together and makes it all possible  that makes the motivation of what you do in your heart?
applause The last thing I want to say is this.
applause That will save everybody money.

applause Now  there's been a lot of misinformation out there about the recovery plan.
applause That shames me  that shames me.
applause It really was a great event.
applause President Bush and I will also continue to defend our society's fundamental rights and values.
applause As those forces gain strength and experience  and as the political process advances  we'll be able to decrease troop levels without losing our capacity to defeat the terrorists.
applause And we are so glad that you're home.
applause In the last two years  we have seen hopeful changes as men and women showed their desire to live in freedom.

applause I have waited  not as President  but as your fellow citizen for over 30 years to see my country once again in the position to build the future of our dreams for our children.

applause We have moved aggressively to prove that you can clean up our environment and promote the public health and advance the economy by doing it -- 50 million Americans are breathing cleaner air.
applause In order to have a vibrant agricultural economy  it must be so that people can pass their farm from one generation to the next without the federal government getting in the way.
applause It's also true that our schools get money from a lot of different places and have to suffer rules from a lot of different places  and a lot of people think if they give up their rule-making  they won't matter anymore.
applause And as always  decisions about troop levels will be driven by the conditions on the ground and the judgments of our military commanders -- not by artificial timelines set by politicians in Washington  D.C.
applause I'm also proud to be here with a leader who is reenergizing the Department of Labor  who realizes that it's not the Department of Management  it's the Department of Labor --   -- a daughter of union members  a daughter of a Teamster -- Secretary Hilda Solis.
applause I can balance a budget because I'm the only one who has balanced budgets.

applause And by the way  you know what they said?
applause By recognizing a fundamental principle: That the strength and the reason for progress in America comes not from what the Federal Government does  or the State government for that matter  but that strength and the progress of this country come from policies which will encourage and stimulate the productive and creative energies of 180 million free  individual Americans.
applause Now  there are lots of companies that are doing this.

applause It is they  the heroic  self-sacrificing few who have made the history of the race and who have paved the way from barbarism to civilization.
applause Ronald Reagan used it in 1980.
applause We've seen the positive effects of tax relief  and we know how to keep a good thing going.
applause First and foremost  of course  we've moved aggressively to try to make America a tougher target -- that is to put in place policies and institutions that make it easier for us to keep out the terrorists.
applause The Jewish people have seen  over the years and over the centuries  that hate prepares the way for violence.
applause And more minority families own their own home than ever before in our history.

applause I will maintain support for empowerment zones  new markets tax incentives  and the Community Reinvestment Act  which I fought hard to hold on to when it was under assault by powerful interests in this country.
applause First  we have them raiding the Social Security Trust Fund  and all this--taking money out of the purpose it was intended for  using it to build up their patronage coffers  expand the government in all kind of ways it that shouldn't have been done in any case.
applause I am proud of that and you should be as well.

applause The temptation in Washington is to say  one-size-fits-all will work.
applause And I'm going to tell them that I am proud we are putting the future of America before the politics of the moment -- the next generation before the next election.

applause Thank you  Florida.
applause But many nations have learned that political equality and independence are not enough without economic equality and independence  and while a Democratic Congress could grant the State of Alaska just the political rights  it will take a Democratic administration to grant this State its just economic rights.

applause My husband has always believed that government can be a force for tremendous good in society  and he appreciates the great work that's done outside of government by compassionate citizens who recognize a need in their community and don't wait for government  but just take action and do something about it themselves.
applause Thank you for introducing me.
applause The real test of the success is not whether I've got a great legislative idea  but whether Congress will set aside its partisan differences and put that idea into law  so we can have more investments in these communities.
applause So today I directed my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward with programs that will help us put patient safety first while allowing doctors to focus on practicing medicine instead of defending against lawsuits.

applause The reason that Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Adlai Stevenson had influence abroad  and the United States in their time had it  was because they moved this country here at home  because they stood for something here in the United States  of expanding the benefits of our society to our own people  and the people around the world looked to us as a symbol of hope.

applause So we come here and ask your help.
applause I do not believe that a political party which in the last 25 years has opposed housing and  minimum wage and social security and every great domestic program which has been identified with progress in this country  which has refused to recognize our changing times around the world  which liquidated the credit which Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman built up in Latin America  which has shown itself wholly uninformed of the present revolution now taking place in Africa  which has failed to maintain our military strength  which has given almost no attention to the important subject of disarmament  having less than 100 people working on it in the entire Federal Government  which has permitted us to be second  best in outer space  which has brought less foreign students to study here today than 10 years ago  which has  in other words  presided over the United States in a changing time and refused to change - I believe on November 8 the people of this country are going to take progress for the future  are going to give the leadership of this country once more to the Democrats.
applause We're proud of the Mills family.

applause One of them is an Army Chaplain named Tim Vakoc.
applause There are many areas of our national life where I think we could do better  but I am concerned today in this State  in this town  with one area which I believe to be almost the most important  and that is how can we improve our educational system so that we can train our people in those qualities of self-discipline and self-restraint and personal character which makes it possible for us to maintain a free society.
applause The choice in this election is between policies that encourage job creation here in America or encourage jobs to go elsewhere.
applause Thank you.
applause Twenty-five million military veterans walk among us  and on this day  our nation thanks them all.

applause Secondly  the Congress must act on a patients' bill of rights -- a good patients' bill of rights  one that recognizes patients are important  not lawyers.
applause Finally  on a very personal--actually not quite finally--on a very personal note  I think only Jim Douglas will know why and he won't know this for a while  but he's beginning to learn it now  will know why I'm about to thank the next group of people  because there's one group of people that spends more time with me that are state employees than anybody else and they have a serious charge and worked very  very hard.
applause It took 14 more years  the unbending will of the CBC  and  ultimately  the willingness of Congress to override a veto.

applause I bring greetings from America.
applause I'd like to ask the members of Congress who are here to stand so you'll see how many we have.
applause Like any piece of policy  there will be second-guessers  and you'll hear them.
applause I also want to say  again  how much I appreciate U.S. Air and the employees for giving us this wonderful terminal to meet in today.
applause So that was really terrific.
applause Like you all  I like to -- I used to like to go down and sit around the coffee shop.

applause We are delighted and proud to have them and know what good friends they are to you and Barbara .
applause And I thank you.
applause Look at her record.
applause Working people everywhere  even if they can't enjoy the same income you do  ought to have access to basic labor rights.
applause Gave an enormous -- an enormous boost to the ideas of family and work by providing tax cuts to over 15 million working families whose incomes were $23 000 a year or less  because we wanted to say to people: We know you've got kids in your home; we know you're working hard for modest incomes; we want the tax system to lift you out of poverty  not drive you into it; we want you to be successful as parents and successful as workers.
applause Women like the pioneers and settlers who  in the words of one  said  “I thought where he could go  I could go.” Women like Dorothy Height and Sylvia Mendez and Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem and Sandra Day O'Connor and Madeline Albright  upending assumptions and changing laws and tearing down barriers.
applause Not because the federal government makes it up in a room somewhere  but because the schools have told us what works.
applause I am honored tonight by the support of a leader of high ideals and fundamental decency who will be an important part of our country's future  Senator Bill Bradley.
applause And Sharon  wife of our senator  your Senator Gordon Smith.
applause They also demonstrate something about the character of our President.
applause You see  you hear a lot of talk about  well  we can't have charter schools or choice because some school is going to be left behind.
applause I used to tell my daughter after I got elected President -- the first time she said  you're too busy for this  that  or the other thing -- I said  let me tell you something  until you leave here  you are still my most important job and don't you ever forget it.
applause The flag you wave stands for freedom.
applause Thank you.
applause So what?
applause But on the other hand  and against all odds after all you've been through  you came through and you voted for me overwhelmingly again last time.
applause We will out-think the terrorists  out-plan the terrorists  outfight the terrorists.
applause Here we are in the hunting lodge of a dictator who subjugated a people; who  in fact  stood for everything that we don't stand for.
applause Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life.
applause It didn't happen because of the vigilance and the great work between the United States and our British allies.
applause We have got the chance now for the first time in the history of our country to give every child  no matter where that child lives  no matter how poor their neighborhoods  the same access to the same information in the same way at the same time as the children of the wealthiest school districts in America  because of technology.
applause In the months ahead  the Iraqis will draft a new constitution  for themselves  and when this constitution has been ratified by the Iraqi people  they will enjoy free and fair elections.

applause I am so proud of what our administration and members of Congress from both political parties have achieved.
applause They were 35-0.
applause I had to go to Washington in this job to find out how the statisticians determine figures about employment and unemployment.
applause It's really about our future.
applause Is the crime rate low enough?
applause Here in Maine and across the nation  good doctors should be able to spend their time healing patients  not fighting off frivolous lawsuits.
applause And since then  some -- more than 25 million of our fellow citizens have taken time off from work to care for a child or an ill loved one without losing their job.
applause As for the United States  the President has made our position very clear: we will work with the United Nations to meet our common challenge; the Security Council resolutions are to be enforced or action will be unavoidable.
applause We're not going to walk away from these children.
applause Indeed  when I mention London Dockland  I must mention the part which Canada is playing in its redevelopment—Canary Wharf.
applause As we see so clearly in Bosnia  allies who share our goals can also share our burdens.
applause Thank you for your good work.
applause I also want to say that if anybody had told me when I left here eight years ago that I could come home with my country having the longest economic expansion in history and the largest number of new jobs in this period of time; where we'd actually be paying down $600 billion of the national debt in the last three budgets of my administration.
applause That's their big deal  eliminate the Department of Education  they say it's a big bureaucracy.
applause Now  just to review: One-third of the money in this bill -- one-third -- was made up of tax cuts.
applause So all the people  the scientists  the engineers  the technology workers  who had lost their jobs had to wait another year just to get these programs started.
applause You play music by ear.
applause Under President Bush  we will continue building a culture that upholds the dignity of every life.
applause We've got a problem; we need to do something about it.
applause This is going to be good economics.
applause “Give us the keys back.”   Well  you can't have the keys back -- you don't know how to drive.
applause If we can pass  by December 15th  if we can get the trading nations of the world to agree on a dramatic reduction of tariffs everywhere  what that means is that American manufacturing products will lead the creation of over a million new jobs in this country in the next ten years.
applause We can win the peace.
applause But we are the United States.
applause In the footsteps of Anthony Eden   who set us the goal of a property-owning democracy—a goal we still pursue today.
applause But it was so wonderful to see all those young people there.
applause And uncomfortably for our opponents  there is now a record on which people can make a judgment.
applause And that means the worst mistake we could make is to go back to doing what we were doing that got us into the mess that we were in.
applause We could not have succeeded in these efforts without the help of dozens of countries around the world.
applause Then we will leave  and we will leave behind a free Iraq.
applause And I appreciate the leadership that Jimmy Hoffa took on good  sound energy policy in America.
applause Nobody is forcing you to shift.
applause I thank you.
applause I must say when I was governor and it was announced that we were losing the JRT Center to Fort Polk  I had some qualms about it.
applause From helping to stand-up the new Iraqi government  to cordon and search operations  to combat patrol and checkpoint security  to the capture and detention of suspected terrorists -- the 48th has shown toughness  great ability  and endurance.
applause What kind of a country will we have with a candidate who cannot make up his mind whether he is going to be old or new?
applause And I think that's a major failing because I don't think we can win the war on terror unless we aggressively go after our enemies.
applause So I want to bring greetings to everybody in Alabama from the President of the United States  George W. Bush  the man you helped put in the White House.
applause We extended and increased unemployment insurance for more than 19 million Americans.

applause I can only say that Cabot Lodge and I have had the experience of sitting across the conference table with him.
applause Eisenhower got elected  reorganized the Agriculture Department.
applause What's the key to that?
applause And there is another issue I hope you'll join me on -- persuading those very same members of both parties to work together to pass a comprehensive and meaningful patients' bill of rights.
applause I'm going to need all of you.
applause And like other generations of Americans  we found that history had unexpected duties in store for us.
applause Third  if medical care is denied  patients should have the right to a fair and immediate review.
applause I mean  most people around the country  it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat  Republican  independent -- you say  well  yeah  of course  that makes sense.
applause God bless you  and thank you all for all you've done to bring this happy day about.
applause Well  I will not and never will do that.
applause Thank you  Kitty.
applause And let me thank Stan Thompson this morning for taking care of us and getting us introduced.

applause We're delighted to be in -- back in Florida  and here in West Palm Beach  especially during the city's 110th anniversary.
applause Those are one-time charges  and they're big  and they'll make our deficits go up over the next two years.
applause It was also a statement of faith.
applause There's no question about it  the evidence is in  the President tax relief plan was right for America -- and it is working.
applause They haven't been standing still.
applause So every 10 Jews  God designed one to be crazy and amuse the others."
applause And I should like to say a word about our friend and colleague John Gummer  whose dedication and tirelessness in those traumatic hours and for many days afterwards won universal admiration.
applause God bless you  and God bless the United States of America.
applause It got 13 votes.
applause That is no exaggeration.
applause But if you take out Social Security  then our opponents in the Senate and the House have committed to a set of promises that mean 30 percent cuts across the board in all those things.
applause They're more interested in tailfins and deodorants than they are in the great national ideals of this country.
applause So we sent our men and women into harm's way -- all volunteers.
applause All Iraqis who have taken the side of freedom have taken the winning side.
applause The outstanding mayor of the city of New York  Mr. Michael Bloomberg.
applause That's why I need your help now.
applause Now I know that Bridgeport is known as the "Arsenal of Democracy" and this is particularly appropriate  what I am going to say here today at this point.
applause The Israelis and its Arab neighbors have sufficient common interest to bring this goal within reach.

applause We've got to keep going until every single one of our children can read well by the 3rd grade; until every single one of our teenagers knows that drugs are dangerous.
applause And the solution is clear: if you want more vibrant trade  if you want more navigatable rivers  if you want busier ports  we need to deepen this channel.
applause John Kerry does not have the judgment or the conviction that America needs in a President.
applause Now don't worry  I'm not talking about world government and giving up our sovereignty  but what makes a sense of community?
applause Senator Allen Frear  Congressman McDowell  Governor-to-be Carvell  Mr. Potter  State chairman  national committeewoman  ladies and gentlemen  I want to apologize for keeping you waiting.
applause The most important result thus far is that the black-market network that supplied nuclear weapons technology to Libya  as well as to Iran and North Korea  has been shut down.
applause But I do think that they hope  and I do feel that we should act not when a crisis comes  not when we have to for our own security pass a desperate action through the Congress  but that we should over the months and years work with them in cooperation  not seeking allies in a cold war struggle  but sharing a desire which we have with them to maintain free and independent countries around the world.
applause You've done so much that the airlift in Bosnia has now surpassed the great Berlin airlift of 45 years ago  both in time and missions flown.
applause Eisenhower got elected; reorganized the government; Dad got transferred to Casper  Wyoming.
applause -- the comforts of Shurz Hall   -- and all those hours circling the campus  looking for a place to park.
applause I think the American people can be confident of a better future  a stronger economy  and greater security against the dangers of a new era  because of the character and the leadership of our President  George W. Bush.
applause We want to get it done right  and then we want to return with honor.
applause You can't even run with your hat now   — you can't keep it on.

applause We know that one of the things we have to do is to provide lifetime learning for all of our people  to give everybody the opportunity to do well.
applause I don't think this State  this country or this society of ours will move ahead until every child who has the talent to develop a superior intelligence  capability  or skill  is given a chance to do it  regardless of his race or his color.
applause And we're disciplined and we're united because we understand history has called us into action.

applause We've been far better at creating jobs.
applause Back in his school days in Pittsburgh  Mike spent a lot of time on the football field.
applause Ask Richie or Marty or Ted.
applause But it is undoubtedly true that many would not.
applause I think the United States must address itself again to the Full Employment Act of 1946.

applause We have to win this election and with your help we are going to.
applause We must work to clean up our environment while we grow our economy and forever dispose of the myth that you cannot have a strong economy unless you are destroying your environment.
applause Maybe now is the moment that I should admit that I was born in Connecticut.
applause We've got a different view.

applause The United States has focused the world's attention on Iran's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.

applause In the Middle East  in Israel  for all the terrible terrorist incidents we see  I want you to know they stop a lot more incidents than ever occur.
applause To accomplish them  we must have serious national conversations  conducted with civility and respect.

applause Thank you.
applause God bless you.
applause The last thing I want to talk about in terms of your decision this year is civil rights and equal justice.

applause The terrorists cite the examples of Beirut and Somalia as evidence that America can be made to run.
applause And you're going to send them a message on Election Day.
applause I want to thank a friend of mine who has been more than a majority leader in helping to put this stuff across.
applause And the community colleges really provide great services to all of our communities.
applause In many ways  I think that the years will be as difficult in the 1960's as they were after the election 100 years ago of President Lincoln.
applause So as Congress thinks through its strategy  let's encourage the private sector to come in and help build those jobs and rebuild those lives.
applause Miscalculations: This is one of the greatest underestimates in recent American history.
applause And lastly  let me say  in addition to that  if you look at what this modern economy requires  we must open the doors of college education to every single American by the year 2000.

applause Now  to put it bluntly  some folks in Washington think all of the doctors in this room make too much money and you shouldn't get any of your money back.
applause Mr. Nixon will enjoy it.
applause We have a full agenda for 2006 and beyond  and President Bush understands that every decision he makes will affect the lives of millions of Americans far into the future.
applause We agree on time limits  tough work requirements  and the toughest possible child support enforcement.
applause If every young person in America would give back to their community in the way you do  just imagine what we could do.
applause And given his record  guess who's going to have to fill that tax gap.
applause We ought to have a tax cut  but it ought to be one we can afford; it ought to be targeted toward long-term care  child care  retirement savings  savings for a college education  giving people incentives to invest in these poor areas of our country.
applause We hope those who are listening become inspired by the examples of our recipients.
applause I challenge all the people who supported us in NAFTA who wanted America to have more customers  to make sure Americans can take advantage of that instead of be punished by it  by retraining the American work force for the 21st century.
applause This woman had been divorced  was living in an apartment with her own two children  struggling to make ends meet  and she had adopted another child.
applause And we thank you for your service.

applause Mr. Speaker  before I begin my prepared remarks  may I point out that tonight marks the 10th and last State of the Union Message that you've presided over.
applause I want to begin by thanking Phil and Pat Frost.
applause We didn't pass my New Markets Initiative  which would give Americans the same tax incentives and loan guarantees to invest in poor areas in America they get to invest in poor areas in Latin America  or Asia  or Africa.
applause But I can assure you  this administration understands the importance of local control of schools.
applause In the first nine months of this year  our exports to Mexico jumped 22 percent.
applause Now  that's my vision.
applause It does not convert -- let's just take the areas of greatest controversy now -- all the fights have come over 200 years over what those two things mean: What does it mean for the government to establish a religion  and what does it mean for a government to interfere with the free exercise of religion.
applause We must keep those liberties  we must keep those liberties under the law  and tomorrow that nation will have its opportunity to demonstrate that courage and that vigilance.
applause I love you  man.
applause But I wonder how often we think about what they mean?
applause You know that millions of people in this country have been discriminated because they don't -- of a preexisting condition.
applause Thank goodness the man from Pinellas County is in charge of the appropriations process  because he knows what I know.
applause Our accomplishments these past four years have made America safer  stronger  and better.
applause The government  in turn  pays the workers a pittance in worthless pesos and keeps the hard currency to prop up the dictator and his cronies.
applause Let me tell you where the strength of the country is: The strength of the country is in the hearts and souls of our citizens  like the people living right here in Lancaster.
applause I don't blame them.
applause And so we're working in Iraq  working with other nations to make sure that Iraq is free and peaceful.

applause We cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in three years than the previous administrations did in 12.
applause Cut investment in roads by over a third.

applause So college affordability is the first part of the strategy that we're pursuing.
applause In 2003  I signed the Protect Act  which allows U.S. law enforcement to prosecute Americans who travel abroad and engage in sex with minors without having to prove prior intent.

applause But it's time for there to be a new way of thinking in Washington.
applause When Pennsylvania elected Harris Wofford against all the odds less than two years ago  you started a movement not just that led to a change in presidents  but that led to a change in America.
applause Now  we have a better opportunity and a better reason to do that now than ever before.
applause And you may have noticed that at the Democratic Convention  I said that I thought we ought to do more in health care  and two things I mentioned -- one  I don't think it's right to throw a new mother and her newborn child out of the hospital before at least 48 hours go by.
applause And  finally  they are our strategic partners.

applause I can stand here today  as President of the United States  and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture  and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.

applause We've overcome a lot of challenges in the last two-and-a-half years  and there will be other challenges.
applause We haven't got a military operation as far as our defense strength is concerned  that everybody agrees is the perfect one but it is just the strongest military power in the world ever seen and we are going to keep it that way and let's tell Mr. Khrushchev that.
applause Let's give him a hand.
applause That's why we ought to increase the minimum wage again -- 10 million working families need it  and we ought to do it.
applause So  Boss  I'm wearing the pin.

applause I've got a good pension  I can buy those government bonds all day long.
applause Whether you were for the Iraq War or not  you ought to want it to work now.
applause With the support of the public employee unions  we have passed budgets which will reduce the size of the national government by a quarter of a million by attrition over five years  and leave us at the end of a five-year period with the smallest federal work force since John Kennedy was the President of the United States.
applause I still believe those things.
applause That's why last week  I signed an order to help end the cruel practice of denying loved ones hospital visitation rights because of who they are.
applause I also want to say a special word of thanks to your President  Joe Duffey  and to his wonderful wife  Anne Wexler  who have been my friends for many years.

applause It's an exciting time to think about that our farmers not only are going to grow what we need to eat  but it's going to grow what we need to run our automobiles.
applause But there are two people that I think it's very  very important to recognize as I get into what our administration's approach to the drug issue will be  because it is clear to me and has been for some time from personal experience that we have to have  in order to succeed here  an enormous effort across this country that goes way beyond the federal government and way beyond law enforcement  that involves citizens supporting our common effort and involves some pretty sweeping cultural changes -- and there are two Americans who have done as much to try to fight the drug problem in that way as any people who live in our country.
applause And Andre Carson and Brad Ellsworth and Peter Visclosky.
applause So we have to do something about this.
applause It's great to see Linda.
applause We are more secure and we're more free because of our leadership in the world for peace  freedom and prosperity  helping to end a generation of conflict in Northern Ireland; stopping the brutal ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo --   -- and bringing the Middle East closer than ever to a comprehensive peace.
applause I want them to say again  "We are going forward with the Democrats.
applause I ask you to join with us in rebuilding the power of this country  in building a stronger America  a better life for our people  and also a day when the United States once again will be looked upon in Latin America and Africa and Asia as the friend of freedom  the way of the future  the hope of the future  the country with which they wish to be associated.

applause And we believe the doors of college should be open to every single American citizen.
applause Thanks to this law we've been able to break up terror cells and prosecute terrorist operatives and supporters inside our country.

applause So as we come to the end of this historic Summit of the Americas  as we proclaim the dawn of this new partnership  as we say we have done this to put our people first and we have kept our eye on tomorrow  let us remember that the road ahead will be full of challenges and difficulties  and that beyond all of the specifics of what we have done  perhaps most enduring is the friendship  the spirit of trust that has been built here.

applause We made it easier for people in small businesses to take out pensions and to keep those pensions when they changed jobs.

applause Thank you so much  everybody.
applause I have nominated superb men and women for the federal courts  people who will interpret the law  not legislate from the bench.
applause And lastly  and I think maybe the most important thing of all for the next generation  I vetoed that tax bill that the Congress passed  the Republicans in Congress passed  because I was convinced that if I signed it we not only could never meet our obligations to our children and to our seniors and to our future in our investments in science and technology -- I was convinced we would never finish the work of paying down our debt.
applause Thank you  Chris.
applause Remember  the enemies of peace don't really need your approval.
applause That's what we discussed at our roundtable  the need for seniors to have a prescription drug benefit.

applause How do you know that there won't be insurmountable pressure in some states just to say  well  we can't take care of these children anymore; we've got to give the money to our school teachers; we've got to give the money to our road program; we've got to give the money to economic development; we've got environmental problems.
applause I ask you to join us.
applause Or you wouldn't have started your own business in the first place.
applause Of course  it bears saying that if Patrick Kennedy hadn't left County Wexford  or if Thomas Fitzgerald hadn't left County Limerick  the American people would have been deprived of the presidency of John F. Kennedy  but also would have been denied one of the finest public servants of this or any age  and a great friend of mine and many of yours  Sir Edward M. Kennedy.
applause When the tornado hit the capital neighborhoods -- and I saw all the trees blown down in the backyard of the Governor's Mansion  and I went over to the grocery store that was flattened -- I saw young AmeriCorps kids from all over this country  working here in Arkansas to try to help fix things and clean things up  and I am grateful for that.

applause Why?
applause I thank you all for participating in this election.
applause He speaks for the interests of this district and he also speaks for the country  I know he is going back to Congress.
applause I don't know any American who is not prepared to meet any responsibilities or bear any burdens in order to maintain his society  and I think it is proper that we should do so.
applause Now  may I turn to one or two of the problems of creating genuine jobs and the figures on unemployment?
applause But if you want to see terror in somebody's eyes you get a parent of a child who's very ill and they don't have health insurance and they don't know how they're going to pay for the next treatment.
applause I thank Debbie for being here  for carrying all of our water all these years and doing all this work.

applause Mr. President  Ambassador Lodge  Governor Rockefeller  my colleagues from the House  Bob Barry  and Ed Dooley  all of the distinguished guests here and this great audience at the airport  one of the things Pat and I have often said as we have been campaigning through this country is this: That all of the crowds impress us and make us feel very humble in your presence  but the one that impresses us perhaps the most is a crowd at an airport  because there is no worse place to come to and park and we thank you for coming  as you have.

applause But still  she longed to go back to work  but she wanted to be her own boss.
applause But why would you get rid of that?
applause And I want that pride to extend all throughout our country.
applause But whether you were for it or against it then  we all have a responsibility now to put forth a plan that offers the best chance of ending the bloodshed and bringing the troops home.
applause As we reauthorize these important reforms  we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.
applause It's great to be back at Heritage.
applause But getting through these years of wartime without an attack on the homeland took more than just luck.

applause In Wisconsin  more than two million taxpayers have seen their income tax bills reduced  more than 700 000 married couples are benefiting from marriage penalty relief  and more than 500 000 families have benefited from the increase in the child tax credit.

applause Now I'm also the only candidate in this race who is calling for a new manufacturing policy  where the maintenance of our industrial base is understood to be vital to our national economic welfare.
applause I was born in the West Wing.
applause But make no mistake  so are we.
applause Incidentally  when that engine went out  the press was all interested in it - one engine on this big four-engine plane  a little tremor - but it's happened so often on my trips abroad - Pat - so that we never worry any more  and they said  "Well  what do you think about it  Mr. Vice President?"
applause So  now  some of you may remember that the last time we were together  as Jill said  it was back in late October of 2008.
applause Do you know that the Soviet Union spends 10 times as much as we do in Spanish broadcasts to Latin America?

applause Let's never forget that when our troops go off to war  they're protecting every single one of us.
applause So we know what's going on out there.
applause So when you talk about tax cuts  you're also talking about the tax cuts that help small business owners expand their businesses and hire more people.
applause The United States is the hope of the free world  but I think the United States can be stronger.
applause And she said  right  and now he'd be Vice President of the United States.
applause The Mayor  in his former life  was actually a member of our administration in the Agriculture Department.

applause I mean  think about what we accomplished here.
applause National home ownership is at a record high.
applause Who can deny that effective action against terrorism must be taken internationally and in the spirit of solidarity?

applause In the first place  I would request the Congress to appropriate additional funds  particularly for strengthening our conventional forces  for speeding up the Minuteman and several other of our missile programs in order that we may not move through a missile gap period in the years 1961 1962  and 1963.
applause So we just want them to operate in a way that's fair and honest and in the open  so that we don't have to go through what we've already gone through.
applause Congressman  I'm proud you're coming.
applause You must believe that.
applause We want you to follow the word.
applause You can now move information anywhere.
applause He deserves the support of every thinking person in America who cares about the direction of the United States Senate.
applause In the middle  President Johnson came 29 years ago this day -- this exact day  President Johnson went to Independence  Missouri  to sign Medicare and to give Harry and Bess Truman Medicare cards numbers one and two.
applause So she came and she was depressed  "I got a 73."
applause In my judgment  the great questions of war and peace  of full employment  of economic growth  of a stronger society  of equal opportunity for all  will depend in the final analysis upon the President of the United States.
applause You've fought hard and reflected tremendous credit on the uniform and on the country.
applause So these things are important and we should feel good about them.

applause And there are some others we should also remember.
applause This Thanksgiving  Americans are especially thankful for our freedom.

applause Ladies and gentlemen  Jim Fazio  Jack English  I first of all want to express my regret to all of you for being so late.
applause We took our coats off inside and Governor Kitzhaber  of course  has established a new tradition that we want to take back to Washington if we can figure out a way to get away with it -- to go to work in blue jeans and without a tie.
applause The President has put forward talented  experienced men and women who represent the mainstream of American law and American values.
applause The Bush tax cuts are working.
applause We not only have a stronger economy  the crime rate has gone down for four years in a row  the welfare rolls are down by nearly 2 million  child support collections are up by $3 billion  40 percent.
applause These rules are a good start  but they are not a substitute for effective legislation.
applause We're proud to have you on the team.
applause He is the kind of fellow that tells you exactly what he thinks.
applause It's just been truly a thrill for me to have her by my side  sometimes in front.
applause Now I would like to ask the children and the people here with me on the platform to join me as I sign the legislation.
applause I've said that for two years.
applause The Bone Crushers of the 2nd Platoon Bravo Company.
applause But we have come closer.
applause The enemy that struck on 9/11 is weakened and fractured yet it is still lethal and trying to hit us again.
applause Prevention.
applause We cannot believe that we cannot reach across party and philosophical lines to find common ground on issues fundamental to our security and the way we organize ourselves as free people.

applause Thank you.
applause We don't usually think  "suck out the brains of a helpless innocent child and crush its head."
applause I've never felt more certain about America's goodness  or more confident about America's future.
applause Wasn't he great?
applause Not always.
applause And I want to also thank all the consumer advocates who are here today who fought long and hard for these kinds of reforms.
applause This program is raising all of them.
applause That will save us billions of dollars; that will pay for every single dime of the program that I just talked about.
applause We've created jobs for 13 consecutive months ?- a total of over 1.9 million new jobs during that period.
applause There is an enemy -- there is an enemy which hates America.

applause And they're completing their mission with honor.
applause And I can tell you  from parliamentary experience  it is not the women who take a long time to make a point

applause That Georgia farmers and American farmers are the best.
applause You can be part of our country  you will be part of our community and you will walk across the bridge to the 21st century.
applause To Malakh and Malikha Shabazz  thank you for joining your family with this commemoration today.
applause We'll be flexible.
applause Don't just talk about -- invest money  time and effort in consistent commitment to drug abuse prevention.
applause The Patriot Act is important.
applause And together we have the power to take back in the White House in 2004 and that is exactly what we're going to do.
applause That is the question.
applause And even though the light is blinding my weakening eyes  I think I see Sam Gibbons out there.
applause Then we honor Coach Anson Dorrance's UNC Tarheel women's soccer team.
applause That's what I thought was going on  and I still believe that was what was going on.
applause In the caves in Afghanistan  we've discovered the fact that the enemy desired weapons of mass destruction  trained hundreds of potential killers that are now spread around the world.
applause Welcome back here.
applause The defeat of tyranny and violence in that nation  and the rise of democracy in the heart of the Middle East  will be a crucial setback for international terror.

applause But whether you're a Wildcat fan or a Cougar fan  we're proud to have you on the Bush-Cheney team.
applause You know and I know that health care is one of those fundamental struggles --   -- because if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who have no health insurance  you live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy.
applause This nation is strong and confident in the cause of freedom.
applause Well  let's see.
applause Their prime targets are the United States and the American people -- so we have a continuing responsibility to lead in this fight.
applause Thank you.
applause It's great to be here with your fine Governor  Jim Thompson  and your Congressman  Jack Davis.
applause Think about that.
applause I signed a bill to end welfare as we know it  but not to take from poor children their medical care  their nutrition  their help if they're disabled  but to say we are going to change this system from one that fosters dependence to one that fosters independence.
applause But we're beginning to see our efforts pay off.
applause I knew seven Presidents had failed.
applause People who have been harmed by a bad doctor deserve their day in court.
applause On vital matters of national security  Senator Kerry offers a record of weakness and a strategy of retreat.
applause Teddy Roosevelt.
applause Unhappy because we bought a phony balanced-budget deal from Bill Clinton that actually expanded this government more than it has been expanded in the last few years  and that from a Republican Congress.
applause Many say that the race in November will be decided in the South.
applause I'm happy that Liggett has also agreed to begin changing their own advertising practices so that they have less influence over young people.
applause I think they know very well that it's far better for us to take on the al Qaeda and destroy their base of operations overseas than it is to have to deal with them here in the United States.
applause You look over the horizon and you ask yourself  what are the big challenges of the future.
applause The man and party who oppose a decent minimum wage also oppose decent wages for our teachers.
applause Why is the Congress holding out for an agreement that would essentially develop a two-class Medicare system  where the older and the poorer and the sicker you are  the more likely you are to be in yesterday's Medicare that's under-funded; and the younger and healthier and more well off you are  the more options you're given to walk away.

applause I appreciate so very much Congressman Chip Pickering and his wife  Lisa  for being here  as well.

applause And I urge the Congress to fully fund my new Freedom Initiative budget requests.

applause And if we don't get around to doing it now  we will never get around to it.
applause And therefore we've got to put plans in place to stimulate our economy; that creates jobs; that says to employers  if you buy equipment  you get a little extra in order to help people find work.
applause But I'm glad to be following in Harry Truman's footsteps with you today.
applause Yes  That's right   I have decided to love.
applause And so I looked at him and I said: That's okay young man  I used to be one myself.

applause The way to create jobs is our pro-growth  pro-entrepreneur agenda.
applause This administration will constantly strive to promote an ownership society in America.
applause I say "we" generously  because Michelle has done most of the work.
applause You know  one of the great things about this country is that there's a lot of loving people here in this country.
applause Indeed there have been quite a lot of rumours and misleading smears circulating.
applause As citizens of this county  you have to make your own responsible judgments on November 8 about what the best thing is for our country  about what we must do  and you have to analyze what Mr. Nixon and I stand for and what our parties stand for.
applause And he will live on the average 7 years less.
applause Where's Patrick?
applause Earlier this week  Senator Kerry told us he is proud that he and Senator Edwards voted against the funding the troops.

applause Governor Romney is here with us today.
applause Anybody who thinks that America has been standing still for the last 8 years  anybody who thinks that the Soviet Union is moving ahead and is going to pass us should go to the Soviet Union and then travel over the United States as I have  and you will see that the U.S. economy today is sound  and strong  productive and free  and it is the first three because it is free and we are going to keep it free in the years ahead.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause Our government has taken unprecedented measures to defend the homeland.
applause We're going to end catch and release.
applause All right?
applause Eisenhower got elected  reorganized the government  Dad got transferred to Casper  Wyoming.
applause Thank you very much.
applause And  secondly  it's important to always remember the role of the federal government -- or any government for that matter -- is not to try to create wealth; the role is to create an environment in which the entrepreneur can flourish  in which a small business owner can grow to be big businesses.
applause It means that Democrats  Republicans and independents aren't just going to vote the way their party label may tell them.

applause They've made great contributions  I realize  in music  they've made great contributions in business  they've made great contributions in law  and the like  they've made great contributions in politics  but there ought to be more in the Republican Party - that's the only trouble.
applause We always thought we could widen the circle of opportunity  and deepen the meaning of freedom  and strengthen the bonds of our community  and be better neighbors around the world.

applause Why are you here?
applause I am telling everybody here  whatever you are  Republican or Democrat or Independent  that when you're electing a President in this year 1960  America needs whoever is best  whether he's Democrat or Republican.
applause When you have more money than you need  it seems like somebody is getting overtaxed and overcharged.
applause We get to see a lot of Ann because of the fantastic job she does as the co-chairman of the Republican Party.
applause We're fine  by the way  those of us born before 1950.
applause If you will forgive me  I would like to close this event by asking my teacher to come up here and accept my thanks for being a working woman over 30 years ago.
applause At the same time  we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities.

applause We doubled the child tax credit  decreased the marriage penalty  cut tax rates across the board  and have put the death tax on the way to extinction.
applause But if that rule still obtained today I think Stephen  would be perpetually on his feet in the House of Commons.
applause It is time for members of the Senate to stop playing politics with American justice.
applause And since we're in New York  I'll make my last pitch.
applause I appreciate Sarah Reese.
applause They reflect extraordinary credit on the United States of America  and our whole country is proud of each and every one of them.
applause And we've had -- this has been a fantastic experience for us  and as a family.
applause Do you remember how the Vice President used to say in the '92 campaign  everything that should be up is down  everything that should be down is up?

applause And the president says stay the course.
applause They'll have a democratically elected government in place by the end of the year.
applause Why?
applause From his pursuit to a nuclear test ban treaty to our efforts to stem the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction -- to actually dismantle much of the world's nuclear arsenal -- we see a common effort for America to be leading the cause of human preservation against nuclear annihilation
applause If you believe that we should give everybody a raise when the economy does better  and you don't want to engage in class welfare; if you believe all these people that are inevitably downsized when big corporations become smaller should have the opportunity to go on with their lives and you don't want to engage in class warfare; if you are perplexed by how we can generate 8 million new jobs and record numbers of new businesses and still have half the Americans not get a raise  one clear area where we ought to debate is whether the conventional wisdom about how fast this economy can grow is right.
applause We understand that the more people that own their home  or own their own business  or own and manage their own health care account  or own and manage their own retirement account  the more people that do that the better off America is.
applause Another million Americans in working families lost their health insurance last year.
applause I ask the support of those who are concerned.
applause On March 9th  I signed an executive memorandum with a clear message: Under my administration  the days of science taking a back seat to ideology are over.
applause And we thank you for your leadership.
applause But the President and I will not be satisfied until every person who wants a job can find a job.
applause That's why you're here tonight  because you know Claire McCaskill is on your side.
applause It's exactly where he begins -- where he belongs.

applause Sixty percent of the kids in this world who are not in school are girls.
applause What's more  when teachers take disciplinary measures they do not always receive the backing from the local authority which they are entitled to expect.
applause I appreciate your leadership.
applause And I'll speak a little bit about that later on.
applause It was a terrible Senate election for us in terms of who was up  who was not.
applause To accomplish them  we must have serious national conversations  conducted with civility and respect.
applause In that regard  and understanding that challenge  I would ask for prayers  and I'd asked for your help  and I'd ask for your determination to be part of that coalition of folks within the Republican party who are going to fight to make sure it stays on the solid ground of American moral principles--to offer the kind of leadership that will not only offer to the American people the prospect that Gore and Clinton and all their moral turpitude will be gone  but that those who will replace them will replace them in the spirit of those true moral principles that will raise the standard of our hope for the better destiny of this world on high.
applause I think we can do better.
applause Thank you  my friends.
applause And I would like to thank the Peace Corps volunteers.
applause Now  if you ask what have we done to reduce the size of government -- and I want to compliment Governor Chiles for his leadership in this -- Florida is one of the -- really  the groundbreaking state in America  I think  in slashing unnecessary regulation.

applause The struggles and the hopes of these Americans are why I ran for office in the first place.
applause And I ask for an honest  open understanding that the Supreme Court decision allowing all of these third-party expenditures will complicate our task.
applause We have not done it  not because of the fault of Republicans as such  or Democrats as such  but because we have not been imaginative enough  we've been too negative  and we have not moved on this problem and made it an asset  as I indicated at the beginning  rather than a liability.
applause Today we remember and give thanks to our mothers.
applause The way forward lies in willing cooperation between independent sovereign states.
applause We do not need to abolish the tax code  we need to abolish the income tax!
applause That's why I spoke out against the recently passed law in Arizona.
applause Any good team obviously requires good players.
applause The bill also had a $5 000 tax credit for people who will adopt children  because there are still a lot of kids out there that need homes.
applause I will.

applause Thank you very much  Senator Boxer  Senator Torricelli.
applause They put their cronies in there.
applause And the issue is  how do we get more money into the coffers of the small businesses like Elson's in America.
applause Because we acted  Iraq today is a free and sovereign nation.
applause You did a great job  and kept a fully-mission capable rate of 85 percent.
applause We need your love.
applause He knows what is at stake.
applause America's doctors should be able to spend their time healing patients  not fighting off frivolous lawsuits.
applause Everybody in America should have a stake --   -- everybody in America should have a stake in legislation that can transform our energy system into one that's far more efficient  far cleaner  and provide energy independence for America -- making the best use of resources we have in abundance  everything from figuring out how to use the fossil fuels that inevitably we are going to be using for several decades  things like coal and oil and natural gas; figuring out how we use those as cleanly and efficiently as possible; creating safe nuclear power; sustainable -- sustainably grown biofuels; and then the energy that we can harness from wind and the waves and the sun.
applause And of course I want to pay special recognition to Kathy Fitzpatrick.
applause He made the election about the future and the people of Massachusetts and he won.

applause Secretary Vilsack  that's something he's focused on.
applause Not now.
applause Good night.
applause The first thing I want you to know is this  I spent a lot of time with Tom and Ruth Harkin when nobody else was looking  when there were no cameras around  no reporters around  no speech to give  no one to impress  no gain from anything.
applause I'm glad she did now  though.
applause Protected by the levees of our health  our jobs  our families and knowing that those levees could break and when they do we could be in trouble.

applause Thank you very much  everybody.
applause Conditions on the ground will dictate our force levels over the next year  but the strategy is what I said it is: We'll stay on the offense  and we'll give these brave Iraqis the skills and training necessary to defend their own democracy.
applause Because America and our allies acted  all the world is now seeing democracy rising in the heart of the Middle East.

applause And finally  some of you not only married someone in uniform  but we sometimes don't remember that many of you also wore a uniform yourself.
applause For the sake of our health care system  we need to cut down on the frivolous lawsuits which increase the cost of medicine.
applause And the only way to do that in our country is to give people the benefit of free or reduced television  radio  newspaper  other communicationS time in return for cutting the cost of their campaign.
applause And then came the campaign of 1984  and I know you must have been as gratified as I was to hear both sides talking about values like neighborhood and family.
applause And I give them a one-word answer -- arithmetic.
applause But under our vision of what we ought to do with the budget  we set aside all $2.6 trillion of the payroll taxes that are heading into Social Security and spend them only on Social Security.

applause Over the past five years  we have caught and returned 6 million people trying to come into our country.

applause And I am proud to stand with them on this platform.

applause I believe that the surplus should be used to balance the budget and pay down the debt so it's not a burden on the backs of these children.
applause All of a sudden  we've gotten a new chief executive in town that says  let's be fiscally responsible.
applause My whole theory is if somebody shows up and says  I'm willing to work hard and I'm willing to obey the law  that's good enough for me.

applause We all know Louisiana hasn't had a Republican senator in some time.

applause And it is about the future of these young people and our future that I want to talk to you today.

applause Now  don't get me wrong  the White House is nice.
applause I got my shoes on.
applause He said  "If we can eliminate the threat on foreign soil  I would rather do it there than have it come home to us."
applause I actually said this in New Hampshire: "I appreciate preservation.
applause I hope she's not watching  you know?

applause The figures for the third quarter of the year 2003 show the economy grew at an annual rate of 8.2 percent  the fastest pace in nearly 20 years.
applause The future will not be easy  but I do think that if we meet our responsibilities here  here in the State of North Carolina  here in the United States  if we build a better life for our citizens here  whether they live in the cities of the North or the South  or whether they live on the farms of this country upon which our economy has traditionally depended  I think as we grow strong here  we hold out an inspiration to all those who wish to follow our example.

applause By the end of this month  we will have removed 100 000 troops from Iraq and our combat mission will be over in Iraq.

applause And he has consistently been on the right side of that future.

applause Elections were held two weeks ago  the first in the 5 000-year history of that country.
applause Anybody here read John Kerry's book The New War?
applause I don't want food or water.
applause No one has ever done it before  and I hope our country can do as well as you have done with each other.

applause And with your help  we shall do it.
applause I'm going to get out there with you.
applause In Iraq  the United States and our allies rid the Iraqi people of a murderous dictator  and rid the world of a menace to our future peace and security.
applause Thank you all for coming.
applause And we just recorded the lowest poverty rates ever recorded for African Americans and all our senior citizens.
applause But the Congress must understand the importance of small business in America  and the Congress must understand that by dropping that top rate  we stimulate growth in the private sector.
applause The fundamental question is  do we increase the size of government?
applause When Mr. Nixon says our prestige has never been higher  I say he is either misinformed or misleads.
applause You also got one of the best governors in the country in Ted Strickland.

applause It is my hope and belief that this new officer of the Government will also be the people's counsel and speak for the people.
applause Third  there are ways to make sure your fund can avoid swings in the market at the very end of -- right before you retire.
applause This initiative should have almost no effect on timber supply.
applause It will mean also that you're going to find taxes going up  because  my friends  looking at their platform and their promises  they cannot pay it off without taking it out of the hides of the American people  and right out of your budgets  and I know you can't stand it  and for that reason I say  yes  let's have progress  and let's have it without inflation.
applause I do not stand here as a conservative because I'm "against government."
applause We will not have  for example  the new rifle to replace the M-1  which was used by you in World War II and Korea  for 5 years  before there is a complete replacement.
applause That isn't surprising when you consider his record on taxes.
applause But if you don't remember anything I say  you remember these two things.
applause This principle  the Bush doctrine  is now understood by all: Any person or government that supports  protects or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and will be dealt with accordingly.
applause I was reading and watching  when they came out recently with the Christian Coalition's "Contract With the American Family."
applause We have reduced by two-thirds the number of regulations the states and the school districts have to deal with under the Federal Aid to Education Act alone.

applause God bless you all and God bless America.
applause It's been terrific to spend the day with her.
applause First  on the military front.
applause And we believe that none of us can be all we would like to be unless we recognize that all of us are part of one community and one family  and we have to help each other in order to make the most of our own lives.
applause We have two other members of the Senate with us here.
applause In the long run  a second-class education always costs more than a first-class education.
applause As the President has said  the nation needs more than a temporary expansion  so we need more than temporary tax relief.
applause But here's what I also know.
applause Glad to be joined by the Executive Director of the Players Association  Don Fehr; Congressman Deutsch  Congressman Foley  Congressman Wexler.
applause Not bad for two days on governance.
applause Florida State Representative Nancy Detert is here  as well.
applause These are people who love this country.
applause One of the lessons that history teaches is that institutions of self-government turn the energies of people away from violence to the peaceful work of building better lives.
applause In addition to everything Don said  I also would be remiss if I did not thank Gerry for his leadership of the special commission I established on the future of the airline industry.
applause We who are pro-choice understand  according to the Roe vs. Wade decision  that the decision to have an abortion is a difficult one  but we also know and will fight for the right of women to make it as a personal decision  and therefore we want to ensure that the law enables a woman  informed by her conscience  with the counsel of whomever she chooses to talk with--her family  her friends  her doctor  her clergy--to make that decision herself.
applause And under all the tax relief we've passed  they saved about $2 800 last year.
applause And don't overlook those disgruntled Democrats  either.
applause Even on the home front  where the attacks actually occurred  we're seeing attempts to undermine vital protections put in place after 9/11 to track our enemies and disrupt their plans.
applause And I repeat  if it's good enough for you in the Congress  it ought to be good enough for working people here in America.
applause And I saw the young and handsome Senator Edward Kennedy inspiring all these young people  along with his brother Robert  to public service in those years.
applause I mean  think about it if this -- if the economy was a car and they drove it into the ditch.
applause And they are unwavering in their mission.
applause No  we need to drop the bottom rate  and we need to make sure that that hard working waitress is more likely to be able to save and dream and build.
applause I was informed when I started out this morning that we were going to travel in Delaware County which voted 8 to 1 for Alf Landon.
applause And a key component of that thinking says that we  as a nation  must trust younger workers to manage their own money  if they so choose  in the private markets  to take advantage of the compounding rate of return  to make sure that not only is there a Social Security system available  that workers from all walks of life have got an asset that they can call their own to pass from one generation to the next.
applause I don't welcome some of the pitched  partisan rhetoric that we've been seeing.
applause I wasn't 100% happy with either of those individuals  but I'll tell ya.

applause We've got a couple -- some applause here.
applause Our nation needs legal reform to protect small business owners and employees from frivolous lawsuits and needless regulation.

applause Ladies and gentlemen  please welcome Irvin Mayfield.
applause We increase discretionary spending by 4 percent.
applause And I feel good about it.
applause The signs are good -- here in Oregon  and even in Massachusetts.
applause That is the same party that voted 90 percent against 25 cents minimum wage.
applause This is about more than economics.
applause Mr. Nixon sent Senator Goldwater through the South saying he does not mean anything he says on civil rights  and Senator Scott of Pennsylvania through the North assuring the Negroes that he is with them all the way.
applause Today  for the first time since 2004  all three U.S. automakers are operating at a profit  the first time in six years.
applause When our country was attacked  Americans did not respond with bigotry.
applause Mayor Bill Haslam  the Mayor of Knoxville  is with us  and his wife Crissy.
applause It's also great to be here with my wife of 25 years who's with me here today; my wife Elizabeth.
applause That was the greatest welcome anyone could have asked for.
applause We liberated the people from the clutches of one of the most barbaric regimes in the history of mankind -- people who refused to educate young girls  people who mistreated women.
applause This is not about my campaign or this is not about anybody's campaign to take back the White House.
applause I have proposed a modernization plan to the Congress.
applause And I call upon the United States Congress to finalize the MCA legislation and to fully fund the first year of this initiative.
applause They never mention that this man—I'm not for extremism in defense of that kind of liberty or that kind of activity.
applause And when we see disease and starvation and hopeless poverty  we will not turn away.
applause Through his leadership on the House Armed Services Committee  Congressman Bradley has secured hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure our troops have the resources they need to keep themselves  and our country  safe.
applause And also the thing that impressed me - everybody in Italy sings - everybody  believe me.
applause The weakest slogans in the history of American politics.
applause How are you  Mayor?
applause And the terrorists are hearing from us all.
applause But if there isn't business growing in all parts of the United States  every effort which Schenectady may make  or the city of Lawrence  Mass.
applause We recognize there are still challenges  especially in our manufacturing communities.
applause And we couldn't do it without you.
applause I would like to see Ohio go Democratic.
applause I want to spend some time talking about this.
applause But I don't want anybody to be able to get your financial or health care record just because they're on somebody's computer somewhere unless you're okay.
applause You see  tax relief will put money in people's pockets  which will help give the economy a second wind.
applause Maybe they know that this year  for the first time  young people will be able to stay on their parents' health insurance until they're 26 years old and they're thinking that just might be popular all across the country.
applause But we said we were going to do it because we had met too many families out there who  because of a preexisting condition  couldn't get insurance.
applause In the war on terror  we will always seek the cooperation of our friends and allies around the world.
applause And I just have to say to you  you make us very  very proud.
applause Every one of you is dedicated to something greater than yourself.
applause But I'll tell you  there is one subject on which I think perhaps only Presidents can really know the truth.
applause When we went into Afghanistan  we took down the Taliban regime.
applause Third  and maybe most important  we tried to expand opportunities for communities and individuals in a way that would enable people to take responsibility for their own lives.
applause It's the same old Washington mind-set: They'll give the orders  and you will pay the bills.
applause I'm proud of my husband for recognizing the challenges that America faces at home and abroad and for taking action to meet them.
applause We represent not only ourselves  but we represent the hope of freedom around the world  and this country  I believe  and this is the issue  has to pick itself up and start moving forward again.
applause To that question  every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding "Yes."
applause And we're more secure because of advances in health care.
applause Obviously  no one can guarantee that we won't be hit again.
applause If this country moves ahead  if the Tennessee Valley moves ahead  Massachusetts and Nebraska and the United States move ahead.
applause We recognise the differing traditions and identities of the two parts of the community of Northern Ireland—the Nationalist and the Unionist.
applause And I believe it vitally important that the next President of the United States understand the revolutionary times in which we live  understand that it is vitally important that this country start to move ahead again  and that the next President of the United States place before the American people the unfinished business of our society  the things that we must achieve if we are going to maintain our freedom  and if we are going to build the kind of society which will inspire people around the world.
applause We're a country where people -- we're a compassionate people.
applause No more fine print  no more confusing terms  no more hiding the truth.
applause But neither should our farmers be subject to unrealistic delays and unfair discrimination based on suspicion unsupported by the latest scientific examination.
applause We must also adapt old policies to suit the changing times  so that they are not an unnecessary drain on Europe's vitality or its resources.
applause You knew this was not about the fortunes of one party -- this was about the future of our country.
applause We're not only fighting for freedom  we're liberating people from the clutches of oppression.
applause I come here tonight as the Democratic candidate for the office of the Presidency in a difficult and somber time in the life of our country.
applause It is a -- there's a wonderfully warm feeling.
applause Against such enemies  our only option is to go on the offensive  to track them down until they have no place left to hide  and to stay in the fight until the fight is won.
applause You're going to be able to buy it  too.
applause Judge Otto Kerner  the next Governor of Illinois  Senator Paul Douglas  my colleague in the U.S. Senate and a distinguished spokesman for the United States  Hayes Beall  the next Congressman  ladies and gentlemen  we have a baby back there.
applause We now have had 100 000 young people  including quite a number from Texas  serve in our national service program  Americorps  serving their community and earning money to go to college.
applause During the liberation of Afghanistan  you transported Marines  making possible the deepest insertion of an expeditionary force into hostile territory in the history of the Marine Corps.
applause Republicans age just like Democrats.
applause -- now I'm one alternative.
applause You have the Republican  a conservative Republican President with the support of the Christian right asking for $3 000 000 000 a year to fight AIDS.
applause And I wanted to take this trip through the heartland to look into the faces  the eyes  the hearts of the people that I ran for President to help  the people I have worked for and fought for for four years.
applause One of the main fronts in this war is right here in Europe  where al Qaeda used the cities as staging areas for their attacks.
applause It was the worst genocide in modern times.
applause Working together  U.S. and Canadian companies have integrated North America's auto industry and staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in all the history of the Industrial Revolution.
applause It's when a Boy Scout leader says to a young child -- says to a young child  you know  there's right decisions to make and wrong decisions  and I want to help you understand a right decision.
applause Those days are over.
applause Where are they?
applause Thank you.
applause It was a wonderful trip and I had such a good time I asked one of my traveling companions to come with me today  Kevin Spacey  who is over here.
applause That means that every one of you has to support that -- not just the teachers.
applause Yes  we can  but they ought to be targeted to the people who need them and to the places that will do the most good -- to child-rearing  to paying for college education  to helping people pay for health care  or to buy a first-time home  or not imposing taxes on the gain people have when they sell their homes because that's the only savings a lot of people have.
applause The second reason I wanted to come here is  I think the government ought to work like you do.
applause Thank you for being here  sir.
applause To clear up the confusion  he added this nuance: "The family has it  I don't have it."
applause In 1952  I was living in Lincoln  Nebraska with my folks.
applause We'll just change the tax system to take you out of poverty.
applause I am very  very proud of that.
applause Welcome  Mr. Secretary.
applause Instead of lowering taxes little by little  the Congress should do it all at once and give our economy the boost it needs.
applause It depends on a national policy of full employment.
applause But we're really proud of the University of Texas.
applause There must be an end to speculation with other people's money.
applause So I'm sensing a pattern.
applause And there's no doubt that this is a serious problem.
applause I can tell you  you would be very  very proud of the mark that Mary Landrieu is making -- not only from what you know here in Louisiana  but if you were in Washington and you heard it the way I hear it from the senators  they believe that she is a fine senator with an unlimited future  and so do I.
applause There's a parade marking independence each year.
applause I don't know how passing health care will play politically  but I do know that it's the right thing to do.
applause But these are the things you can.
applause We gave that regime a choice: Turn over the terrorists  or face your ruin.
applause But here's the key  is to not let the moment slip away.
applause Thank you  Congresswoman Pryce  for your commitment to Ohio's children.
applause We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform.
applause And we believe that Americans ought to be able to say "under God" when they pledge allegiance to their flag.
applause I was asking about that castle on the way in  by the way.
applause And so now it my honor  right here at this important Department  the Department responsible for encouraging homeownership in America  to sign the American Dream Downpayment Act.
applause Not a single hunter or sportsperson in Arizona or Arkansas has lost a weapon  but 60 000 felons  fugitives and stalkers did not get handguns because of the Brady Bill.
applause And this President is not going to allow regimes such as Iran  Iraq and North Korea to threaten our way of life.
applause I don't know about you  but I'm not tired.
applause And he's the one  after all  who's responsible for picking those staff lawyers at the Justice Department  responsible for those embarrassing memos justifying and enabling torture.
applause After just one year  she joined the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater  where her shooting star connected with Alvin's.
applause If we say  okay  we're going to have more waivers and you're going to be able to experiment in projects that use federal dollars  let's measure the experiment  let's be honest about it.
applause It will make a dramatic difference to American education.
applause Two outstanding congressmen who supported me early in my race for the presidency  Steve Rothman and John Adler.
applause And I know that 20 days from now  if we decide that together we're going to build that bridge  that our best days are still ahead  and your best days are still ahead and America will still be the greatest country in human history in the 21st century.
applause As a candidate  I promised that I would end this war  and that is what I am doing as President.
applause This is not an enemy we can reason with or negotiate with or appease.
applause For nearly 40 years he's been here.
applause Ours is the cause of freedom.
applause In order to participate in the other great freedoms we have to have a standard of living for our people so that they can enjoy them.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause I recently signed two executive orders to address this issue.
applause There are no second-rate children in America and there are no second-rate dreams.
applause We faced a basic decision -- to leave more of the hard won dollars of the American people with people for their purposes  or take those dollars for the federal government.
applause And here at home I think we have an opportunity to help change a culture -- one that has said  if it feels good  go ahead and do it; and if you've got a problem  blame somebody else.
applause He understands the importance of supporting our troops in harm's way.
applause So every one is for change in general  but when you get particular  then it's another thing altogether.
applause She's right back there?
applause They must be able to be both.
applause It's a lot better off.
applause We have got a war to win.
applause But  more importantly  it gives me a chance to speak to some of the finest Americans we have  our soldiers and their families.
applause We had to begin to make our government work for ordinary Americans again.
applause I'm pleased to share this honor with such a distinguished group.
applause They have shown such courage and have stuck to it in some very difficult circumstances  and are consistently showing the kind of leadership we need.
applause Mr. Mayor  thank you for your hospitality  as well.
applause But he's out there helping people in Connecticut  in Colorado  in Washington  Wisconsin  and California.
applause That's not how you build a better future.
applause No one has worked harder or more effectively to make that point  here and around the world  than our next speaker.
applause And I often tell people that we have a Republican marriage  that we got married because Dwight Eisenhower got elected President in 1952.
applause Just two weeks ago  millions of Afghans voted in their first free presidential election in the history of their country.
applause Give us your hand  your voice  your support.
applause Making sure that folks who lose their jobs still have health care.
applause He loves his children more than life.
applause For the sake of health care  we also need to cut down on the frivolous lawsuits which increase the cost of medicine.
applause I say again  you deserve most of the credit here; the Sheriff  Lieutenant Washington  Yvonne McPherson  all of you that work in this  these police officers.
applause It is important to learn the lessons of what happens when scientific evidence and clear authoritative warnings are ignored in order to induce our leaders not to do it again and not to ignore the scientists again and not to leave us unprotected in the face of those threats that are facing us right now.
applause Thank you for taking the assignment.
applause And his first and most solemn duty is to protect our country and to protect the people of the United States.
applause We need you.
applause We have been in Vancouver  Wash.  in Portland  Oreg.
applause The math has changed this way: Baby boomers like me are getting ready to retire  and there's a lot of us.
applause And not a single Indiana hunter has missed a day in the deer woods  not a sports person has missed a single sporting event  but a half a million felons  fugitives and stalkers couldn't get a handgun because of the Brady Bill.
applause Everybody in Texas needs to come and see it.
applause Now I would like to ask Cheryl and Chaim Subon to come up.
applause Okay.
applause We're proud of you  Tiffany  proud of the work that you're doing.
applause Today  the Serbian leader who began the Balkan wars  Slobodan Milosevic  has been deposed by his own people.
applause Well  look  it is wonderful to be here.
applause And let me thank you for your introduction  and let me thank all of you for that warm welcome.
applause We remembered the nature of Saddam Hussein.
applause His name is George W. Bush  our President.
applause And it helps if you have a partner in the White House and if you really are working together to take responsibility instead of to place blame.
applause The economy is growing again.
applause And we know that successful politicians have families who stand with them and are with them all the time.
applause We have to find jobs for our people  and I can assure you in 1960 if we are successful in this election  we will give this country leadership and the United States will start moving once again.
applause All men are created equal.
applause Melody Barnes.
applause Thank you all for coming.
applause Mr. Vice President  thank you for that introduction and for your leadership to advance the technological revolution in America and especially to bring its benefits to all of our children.
applause It is time for a New Patriotism  where America's sovereignty is wholly and fully restored.
applause As a small country in a tough part of the world  Israel has always had to be on guard against enemies to have a clear-eyed view of potential threats  and to confront dangers squarely.
applause And that's exactly how he will continue to lead the country for the next four years.
applause I appreciate so many folks showing up tonight  and I'm honored to be introduced by a great Governor.
applause It is far cheaper for us to pay America's fair share of putting 130 000 000 kids in school  helping the kids live  who are now dying of preventable childhood diseases  finding an appropriate global response to the AIDS crisis and other healthcare crises.
applause I ask you to join us in serving this country  in building this country  in demonstrating what this country can be  in demonstrating what freedom can do  in showing the people who sit on the razor edge of decision that we represent the future  that the Communist system is as old as Egypt  and in our great free society there are inexhaustible veins of energy.
applause When I was first elected President I never could have dreamed that a lot of the things that would occur in the last five years have occurred.

applause We were falling behind and unable to compete internationally.
applause Admittedly  looks and photos can be deceiving.
applause If you are to make a choice  a choice in the best interests of the Nation and of Georgia and of yourselves  it must not be as has been indicated by the mayor and by Jimmy Carmichael a "blind" choice  it must be an intelligent choice.
applause My wife  Susan --   ; my daughter  Andrea --   ; my son  Thomas --   ; and two very special people who have been really my surrogate parents for over 30 years  my father-in-law and mother-in-law  Joe and Joan.
applause One year later  thanks largely to the Recovery Act  we can stand here again and say that a second depression is no longer a possibility.
applause If this bill would have become law  American taxpayers would  for the first time in our history  be compelled to fund the deliberate destruction of human embryos.
applause They knew that the beginning of freedom spelt the beginning of the end for Communism.
applause It's great to be in Lima.
applause But the skeptics  they weren't listening.
applause I come here today in a campaign for the office of the Presidency.
applause serve with him.
applause The four of you can sit down.
applause Because he understands how this system works.
applause Now  I want to just make this point.
applause Problems years in the making -- such as the long term threat to Social Security -- are no longer being left to another day.
applause But we will  over time  find and defeat the enemies of the United States.
applause Now  Lynne mentioned that she'd known me since I was 14 years old.
applause And together  next Tuesday  we'll see our cause forward to victory.
applause We'll provide a big enough budget to equip and support our armed forces in their vital task of defending our country and defending our freedom.
applause Mother might have a different view.
applause Understand the scale and the scope of this plan is right.
applause All of us have aspirations and hopes and dreams that we can't completely live out in the present moment.
applause Your senators aren't here today  but as President of the Senate  I can speak with some authority on their performance on the job.
applause It is our strength and not their goodwill that has brought the Soviet Union to the negotiating table in Geneva
applause You see  I believe a person ought to be allowed to pass their assets on to whomever they want without the government taxing them twice  once while you're alive and right after you die.
applause Sometimes we take your hard work and statistics for granted.
applause And I still believe that when it comes to defining the future  the American public will be with the new Democratic Party instead of the right wing of the Republican Party which is driving their agenda.
applause That's the responsible thing to do.
applause Let me talk to you and tell you about my position on the New Hampshire primary.
applause Some might look at these ambitions and wave them off as extreme and mad.
applause You grow cotton and grains in this congressional district  but every cotton farmer and every grain farmer in this district knows that he is successful or unsuccessful  depending upon the policies of the U.S. Government.
applause I believe younger workers --   -- I believe younger workers -- younger workers ought to be able to take some of their own payroll taxes and set up a personal savings account  an account they call their own.
applause But I'm not going to dwell on that for too long  because in spite of all the media hype--and they have been hyping it for some time now  trying to convince us that Bill Clinton is somehow out there living and breathing--I frankly don't think he is any more politically alive today than he was in 1994 when even his own party people didn't want to have anything to do with him.
applause I saw our fine soldiers in the Persian Gulf standing up for freedom there.
applause Thank you very much.

applause When this happens then the bitter memory of 1928 will begin to fade  and all that will remain will be the figure of Al Smith  large against the horizon  true  courageous  and honest  who in the words of the cardinal  served his country well  and having served his country well  nobly served his God.
applause In the face of those who would divide us  we must remain steadfast in supporting the arts and humanities as a way of coming together while we celebrate our diversity.
applause Let's get it straight  it's about one thing  it's about the acknowledgment of the God upon which this nation and our laws are founded.
applause So that's an important issue.
applause So thank you very much.
applause Our nation thanks you for your efforts and your work.
applause Well  the heroes are the citizens across this country who are asking for tax justice.
applause Yet our national interests involves more than eliminating aggressive threats to our safety.
applause Thank the Woodson family.
applause I know this will make Representative Gephardt feel good -- there's a lot of folks from TWA here.
applause We also need to continue our efforts to break down trade barriers and open up markets around the world.
applause It is a contest between all citizens of this country who believe that progress is our most notable product  who believe it incumbent upon us as the chief example of freedom to build a strong and vital society  and between those who wish to stand still.
applause And finally  we've got some special guests  some of the finest attorney generals who are fighting against consumer fraud and have been dealing with some of the consequences of the issues that we're discussing here today -- I'm proud to have them here: My former seatmate in the Illinois State Senate  Attorney General Lisa Madigan; Andrew Cuomo of New York; Martha Coakley of Massachusetts; and Roy Cooper of North Carolina.
applause Our two nations have a lot in common  when you think about it.

applause We are a caring nation  and our values should also guide us on how we harness the gifts of science.

applause But we're all here specifically to make absolutely certain that Terry gets reelected to the United States Congress  Second District of Alabama.
applause They say that Americans are taking 90 percent of the casualties.
applause Don't give them the keys back!
applause Africa also stands -- also stands to gain even greater benefits from trade if and when we lower trade barriers worldwide.
applause She's an Iowa farm girl.
applause That is the best answer.
applause In my book  she's a fabulous First Lady.
applause That's the education that takes place within the walls of this university  and that is the work that must be done to keep our nation safe.

applause Thank you.
applause Thank you for coming.
applause Finally  we're going to give the people who own these companies  these financial companies -– mainly investors and pension holders and shareholders like many of you -– we want you to have more say in the way they're run.
applause So I thought the President did a superb job tonight.
applause And it worked.
applause Saxby knows what I know: That we're the best producers in the world.
applause And I thank you for that.
applause I will help you get the bad people.
applause Laura and I are honored to be here in Afghanistan with you.
applause People who work in this field for years have come here from all parts of the country and they sit right here today.
applause I think those are American issues the Democratic Party has done very well on  and I don't understand all this.
applause They both said that Israel is willing to make painful compromises for peace.
applause When my husband was governor of Texas and Secretary Paige was superintendent of the Houston School District  George started the Texas Reading Initiative to provide scientifically based reading instruction for all students.

applause Think of the headlines you have avoided.
applause I believe that this is a time of danger and of opportunity.
applause We have great musical organizations.
applause So to adopt a purely defensive posture  to simply brace for attacks and react to them  is to play against lengthening odds  and to leave the nation permanently vulnerable.
applause And I want you to believe that we can do these things.
applause As Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces  I thank these brave Mongolian soldiers  and all who have served on the front lines of the war on terror.
applause They have not called it a distraction or a diversion from their war against the United States.
applause Thank you  Joan.
applause We talked a lot at the governor's meeting today about the livability agenda that I put forward with the leadership of the Vice President  Carol Browner  Rodney Slater  Dan Glickman  to try to help our communities manage their traffic problems  their toxic problems  their need for more green space with no federal mandates and a lot of empowerment.
applause His motives were questioned  his credentials were challenged  and his loyalty to this nation maligned.
applause The days of discriminating against religious institutions  simply because they are religious  must come to an end.
applause And I thank you for reminding me again what this is all about.
applause I presume those who now oppose tax relief are for raising your taxes.
applause Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world  and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives  government should do more  not less.
applause And we believe that Americans ought to be able to say "under God" when they pledge allegiance to their flag.
applause Bob supports the Presidential Line Item Veto  which will help eliminate unnecessary spending from the federal budget.
applause Nobody can dispute the fact that if we don't tackle surging health care costs  that we can't get control of our budget.
applause There shouldn't be loopholes and special tax breaks and lack of oversight.
applause I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal  and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles.
applause New Choices works with local employers to provide domestic-violence victims -- especially single mothers -- with jobs and life skills training  so they can build new lives for themselves and their children.
applause So we did what it took to rescue our economy and spark its recovery.
applause The bill also included tax incentives that will bring a new biodiesel facility to the Port of Stockton  and create high-paying jobs for the 11th district.
applause We are standing for freedom and security  and that is a cause we are proud to serve.
applause Yes!
applause Thank you.
applause We ought to reward work.
applause I do not run for the Presidency under any expectation that life will be easy for the next President of the United States or easy for the citizens of the United States.
applause If you are weak-fibered and fainthearted you will be lost to the Socialist movement.
applause I urge all nations  including the nations of Africa  to encourage a return to democracy in Zimbabwe.
applause Michael  thank you very much for having us here.
applause I must say  when I landed at the airport and they told me that I couldn't take the helicopter to Galesburg  I'd have to drive  I was actually kind of happy because I got to drive across the farmland.
applause And the obvious is this: when they come to you and talk to you about separation of church and state  and when they come and say  "When you talk about God anywhere in public life  then you're bringing God into politics"--no  I'm not.
applause And that regime is no more.
applause This city escaped Hurricane Donna.
applause It says  people can decide you win  and you don't win.
applause Candidates of ideas need not apply  as both parties  both parties seek out the hollow men  the malleable men  willing to read from teleprompters speeches scripted by consultants and pollsters to whom the latest read-out from the Focus Group is sacred text.
applause So he found seven small businessmen.
applause We can make America move again.
applause And I want to know the secret before we go any further with this friendship of ours.
applause It will not happen  and Cabot Lodge and I believe we have the kind of leadership that will avoid it happening  ass President Eisenhower has avoided it happening.
applause As you know  I'm a strong believer in democracy and free elections  but that does not mean we have to support elected officials who are not committed to peace.
applause I don't know anything about politics.
applause It is essential that Americans understand the nature of this border.
applause From beginning to end  this mission was a testament to the skill and professionalism of America's Armed Forces.
applause It is no accident that we haven't been hit in more than four years.
applause And of course  next Tuesday I have a little rendezvous with destiny.
applause I was just discussing this with your commander  but I think it's something that all of you know.
applause My favorite one is that one back there that said  "I'd vote for anyone smart enough to marry Hillary."
applause But think about this: She was fighting that whole time not just to get me elected  not even to get herself health insurance  but because she understood that there were others coming behind her who were going to find themselves in the same situation and she didn't want somebody else going through that same thing.
applause But a President -- a President -- always casts the deciding vote.
applause FICA currently operates 38 000 banks in 21 countries.
applause Thank you so much.
applause The 184 whose lives were taken in this place -- veterans and recruits  soldiers and civilians  husbands and wives  parents and children -- left behind family and friends whose loss cannot be weighed.
applause Well  welcome to the White House  everybody.
applause Just let's have a look.
applause And  finally  by taking these steps  they will have an opportunity  a fantastic opportunity to build a modern economy and create the institutions and habits of liberty.
applause I want to thank all of you for being here this evening.
applause There are many other areas that I could touch on today  but I would like to hear from you  so let me mention just one more before we go to questions.
applause I ask your help in this campaign.
applause We took action to face all these challenges  and today our economy is strong  and it is getting stronger.
applause For that reason alone  Santini is the one.
applause I want to start by recognizing some folks in my administration who are big fans of this team -- Lisa Jackson --   -- from the EPA; Secretary Donovan from HUD; --   -- Craig Fugate from FEMA.
applause I think we were right.
applause He will never again brutalize the Iraqi people.
applause And I want to state clearly and unequivocally the conclusion that I have reached based on all that we have seen in the last weeks and months of campaigning.
applause So you have to decide in the President's race and in the Senate race  do you want to balance the budget and have a targeted tax cut for education and child rearing and protect Medicare and Medicaid for folks with disabilities and poor children  our seniors in nursing homes.
applause This week  young girls will be going to school for the first time  because we got that barbaric regime out of power.
applause He was a part of Operation Pedro Pan.
applause Wise stewardship means taking a second look at the way business has often been done in the Nation's Capital.
applause In Afghanistan we defeated the Taliban regime  but that was just the first step.
applause He said  "We now know.
applause Where there is too much deprivation and too little tolerance  differences among people will always seem greater  and will always be like open sores waiting to be turned into arrows of hatred by those who will be advantaged by doing so.
applause We appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.
applause Thank you very much.
applause And there can be no doubt that George W. Bush is serious about fighting it and winning it.
applause So thank you all again  and I'll come out and shake some hands.
applause Those are the kind of races we all wish we had.
applause And one of her most important jobs will be simply to educate the American people about the scope of this problem and what should be done and how to root it out.
applause Lincoln said 100 years ago that this Nation cannot exist half slave and half free.
applause We have worked hard to improve education  but we must do more.
applause And if I have contributed in some way to what has happened that is good for America  I am grateful for that as well.
applause And that young man  Rodney Slater  is now the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration  investing billions of dollars in growing the American economy through infrastructure.
applause In manufacturing  we have Medrad Incorporated  of Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania.
applause Thank you  Jason.
applause It also means they'll have to cut Medicare  Medicaid  education and the environment even more than they did in that budget I vetoed.
applause When your spouse is in politics  you're involved whether you want to be or not.
applause Was that some great speech?
applause So we gave our military the resources and respect they deserve.
applause So if you look at these choices  the choice is not the standard choice.
applause They are my rocks.
applause And George and I want to thank each and every one of you  everyone who is out here.
applause I will be happy to return.
applause He is not going to care whether we take a hard line or a soft line  restrict him to Manhattan or invite him to Camp David.
applause This campaign has taught me much; that leaders must be tough enough to fight  tender enough to cry  human enough to make mistakes  humble enough to admit them  strong enough to absorb the pain and resilient enough to bounce back and keep on moving.
applause He's a great brother and a fine governor.
applause And we have an even better chance this time than we did then  with no great internal crisis and no great external threat.
applause The country owes you something in return for your sacrifice.
applause But we must go further  and one important step we can and must take is restoring the so-called "pay as you go" rule  or PAYGO.
applause We didn't come this far by letting a handful of irresponsible folks on Wall Street or insurance companies or special interests run wild.
applause For us  they are something so fundamental that they cannot be given or taken away by any government or human agency   and those who would have us believe that speaking out about human rights runs counter to the aim of better relations play into the hands of the enemies of freedom.
applause And so  I came here one last time as President to New Hampshire to thank you for making me the Comeback Kid --   -- but more  and far more important  to thank you for making America the Comeback Country.
applause The man and the party who oppose medical care for the aged have no more compassion for the small farmer or the small businessman  or hungry families here in the United States or around the world.
applause Well  now  what counts in this country of ours  what we can do for it  how we can make it move again?
applause A White House staffer in the aftermath of Watergate  I watched Gerald Ford restore confidence in government by the sheer decency and force of his character.
applause And to all of you who had anything to do with that day or the one before  to all of you who helped me in 1992 in the primary and then to win this state in the general election -- which surprised everybody in the world --   -- I want to thank you.
applause She's set up what's called the Laura Bush Foundation  and in working with the private sector has awarded more than a million dollars in grants to 20 schools to purchase new books.
applause I want to thank the guy who wrote this on the card wrong.
applause That means we're saving billions of dollars that will go directly to students  including students right here at Carnegie Mellon.
applause And on October 9th  there will be free elections in Afghanistan.
applause that   Yes!
applause I say  finally  today that when we hear  if we do  that there are dangers all over the United States from some charge that our military are second place  that our economy is second rate  that our scientists are a failure  that our education is not as good as that in other lands  let me say that true patriotism and true loyalty must be critical of our country insofar as criticism is justified because whenever there is anything wrong with the country we want to correct it and make it better.
applause We think it ought to be expanded.
applause Senator and Mrs. Reigle  thank you for coming.
applause Interests Section in Havana  for being here.
applause Thank you all.
applause And I've been assigned this job  this task because I have known him for so long.
applause The company estimates that this investment will help create or save hundreds of jobs in the area.
applause I love her dearly.
applause And  of course  it's a great joy to welcome Lynn Cheney  as well.
applause We can't have a balanced budget if you walk away from our commitment to guaranteed medical care for the elderly  for families with persons with disabilities in the family  for pregnant women and for poor children.
applause He went to take on the big issues  and to make serious reforms.
applause I leave it up to Admiral Olsen to determine the definition of "minor."
applause It gives those folks who are on the front line of fighting terror the same tools -- many of the same tools that are used to track down drug kingpins or tax cheats.
applause And I hope you're here tonight because you like politics.
applause I want to thank Congressmen Jack Kingston and Joe Wilson for being here  along with Nancy Coverdell  and our fine candidate for Congress in the third district  Calder Clay -- who's going to win this time around.
applause Romare Bearden was born in Charlotte  North Carolina  but grew up in Harlem  where he was influenced by the music and culture of jazz.
applause Yes!
applause So we have to acknowledge all of them for their hard work.
applause And patients and doctors  not insurance company bureaucrats  will make medical decisions.
applause The condition of women in all three of these areas is profoundly important.
applause I can assure you that if we are successful  we are  going  to begin to move again.
applause Suzanne Stahl  who I happen to have met  is standing right over there.
applause The Congress should finish work on a faith-based bill to support the armies of compassion -- for mentoring children and caring for the homeless and offering hope to the addicted.
applause And I can't thank Jon Kyl enough for making sure the judges I nominate get a fair hearing and an up or down vote on the floor of the United States Senate.
applause I was in the state just a couple of months ago to campaign for Secretary of State Matt Blunt  who will be the next governor of the state of Missouri.
applause And after all  you've got to be optimistic to give six months of your life running the McGovern campaign in Texas.
applause It will not be used for new tax cuts.
applause As President Bush said recently  "It is a ridiculous notion to assert that because the United States is on the offense  more people want to hurt us.
applause When you put that with the initiatives in trade that this administration has taken -- more in 18 months than had been done in a generation -- we have the basis for the first growth in America in 30 years that is led by investment and that has no inflation -- in 30 years.
applause And this nation has made a decision: We will engage the enemy  facing him with our military in Afghanistan and Iraq today  so we do not have to face him with armies of police  firefighters  and medical personnel on the streets of our own cities.
applause No doubt the Senator will try to offer a very nuanced explanation of this apparently glaring contradiction.
applause We will keep them close to our hearts and in our prayers.
applause We really are the best advertisement for freedom.
applause Americans believe that freedom is the deepest need and hope of every human heart.
applause Those who walked by faith across this bridge led us all to a better tomorrow.
applause But he got together with people and he realized  he looked at the books and he said my job as the leader of this nation is first and foremost to deal with this deficit.
applause Appreciate it.
applause DeGioia hired him and he's working.
applause We are grateful for her.
applause That's what you did.
applause A lot of times in education people focus on process.
applause The dropout rate is down  the college-going rate is at an all-time high thanks  in part  to the biggest expansion of college aid under our administration in 50 years.
applause We should increase the Pell Grant program  not reduce it.
applause We've got it down for four years in a row; if we bring it down for four more years in a row  we may finally get to where we like living in this country and we feel secure in all of our neighborhoods  in all of our cities.
applause And I'm concerned about debt  too.
applause In 10 countries scattered around the world  he asked them the single question  "Do you believe by 1970 the United States or the Soviet Union will be first  militarily and scientifically?"
applause Americans believe that freedom is the deepest need and the deepest hope of every human heart.
applause Now we're told by some that law and order shouldn't be an election issue.
applause I come here today and ask your help.
applause That is what we ought to be about.
applause The previous administration and Congress looked at the intelligence and made regime change in Iraq the policy of our country.
applause Unlike efforts to liberate a town or destroy Taliban equipment  success against these cells may come more slowly.
applause And with our friends we are building that house of freedom -- for our time and for all time.
applause We've got a lot of veterans here.
applause But it's great to be back to visit America's South Coast  and I appreciate the warm welcome right here in Houma.
applause Yet I have just spoken  as I said  with several Rwandans who survived the atrocities  and just listening to them gave me reason for hope.
applause This is a great country  but it is our obligation as long as we bear responsibility  it is our obligation to make a greater country.
applause This isn't about -- unlike No Child Left Behind  this isn't about labeling a troubled school a failure and then just throwing up your hands and saying  well  we're giving up on you.
applause There's lots of evidence that young children  especially from disadvantaged backgrounds  get a very bad signal if they show up at a school where the windows are broken  or they have to be boarded over and it's dark and the paint is always peeling and they can't get what other kids can do.
applause After the foundry closed  the property sat in disrepair.
applause And so therefore  this bill pays attention to reading.
applause And because higher education is the dream of so many Americans  he will make Pell grants more available so millions more Americans can get that college diploma.
applause Thank you.
applause Oh  yes.
applause So I also must now to call on you to finish the job both Houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year.
applause We believe in individual decision-making.
applause But John Kerry doesn't know if those explosives were even at the weapons facility when our troops arrived.
applause And that's exactly why I'm here.
applause One day more than 30 years ago  inside the Yale Law Library  a fellow student walked over to Bill Clinton and said  "If you're going to keep staring at me  and I'm going to keep staring back  we ought to at least know each other's name.
applause They're for the powerful.
applause But in effect what happened  in 1952  I was living in Lincoln  Nebraska with my folks.
applause And there -- it's simply inexcusable in a man who be Commander-in-Chief.
applause So I'm here today to urge all of you to do so.
applause Thank you very much.
applause It means quitting smoking.
applause I believe that they are tired of standing still.
applause Never -- never again must it be stolen away.
applause Yesterday was a historic day  but it was just the beginning.
applause Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.
applause They try to confuse you and me by calling them Moors  so that you and I won't know what they were.
applause I tell you  he is a -- one of my first lunches was with the Mayor  and I'm impressed.
applause That suggests Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza  the vast majority of the West Bank  the incorporation into Israel of settlement blocks  with the goal of maximizing the number of settlers in Israel while minimizing the land annex.
applause America is not like a blanket - one piece of unbroken cloth  the same color  the same texture  the same size.
applause Thank you  ma'am.
applause No  you couldn't.
applause Teaching is such a noble profession.
applause The same bill contained a tax cut for small businesses who create most of our jobs so they can invest more in their businesses and made it easier for them to take out pensions for themselves and their workers and for the workers in small businesses to keep those pensions when they change jobs.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause Laura and I have enjoyed getting to be with you.
applause And we're all very proud of them.
applause Mel is Pedro Pan.
applause I really appreciate that.
applause And we thank you once again for the great honor of this noble celebration of March 25  1821.
applause That old Uncle Tom-type Negro is dead.
applause Artemus Ward from Massachusetts  my own State  50 years years ago  said  "I am not a politician and my other habits are good  also."
applause The President and I know better than that.
applause In a particular way  as Germans  we have experienced this when we received the gift of unification.
applause You make the home town mighty proud.
applause Soon we will have ready for my signature the community development bank proposal  thanks in no small measure to Congressman Rush  Congressman Flake and Congresswoman Waters.
applause Thank you for being here and thank you for your enthusiasm.
applause Gathering the best information  and getting it into the hands of the war fighter  makes all the difference for the safety of our forces and the security of the nation.
applause My hope is to change the culture from one that has said  if it feels good  do it; if you've got a problem  blame somebody else -- to one in which every single American understands that he or she are responsible for the decisions that you make; you're responsible for loving your children with all your heart and all your soul; you're responsible for being involved with the quality of the education of your children; you're responsible for making sure the community in which you live is safe; you're responsible for loving your neighbor  just like you would like to be loved yourself.
applause But I can't tell you how proud I am of Laura Bush  she has done a fabulous job.
applause And every business in America needs to know our vets have the training  they've got the skills  they have the dedication -- they are ready to work.
applause His back-and-forth reflects a habit of indecision  and sends a message of confusion.
applause And now  from the first day an American is unemployed  he or she should be eligible from day one for new training and new job search and new opportunities.
applause We will see the incomes go up.
applause Today is a day of sorrow for America in our efforts around the world to bring peace because just yesterday  as Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their progress in peace in the Middle East  a young corporal named Nachshon Waxman was murdered by terrorists who are the enemies of peace in the Middle East.
applause Terrorists declared war on the United States of America  and war is what they got.
applause It's about as dangerous.
applause Its methods were those of the collective  of putting all decisions to the centre  which was why it was not our creed  but its aims to raise the living standards of the people were the same as ours.
applause I don't accept that view at all.
applause They're targeting brave Iraqis who are leading toward democracy  such as Mr. Saleem  who was assassinated in Baghdad on Monday.
applause At our convention in New York  President Bush outlined his agenda for a new term.
applause Our use of Reserve components has been one of the secrets of our success.
applause Let me make it clear I do not come here with an escort.
applause Mr. Benson  who has been the Secretary of Agriculture for 8 years  is in Mr. Nixon's own words  the most remarkable Secretary of Agriculture in history.
applause With Larry in Congress  President Bush and I will also continue to defend our society's fundamental rights and values.
applause And finally  I want to pay homage to the First Lady of Panama.
applause This is terribly important.
applause He said that Iraq was  quote  "the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time."
applause I would like to recognize the other survivors who are here today and their families: Mr. Charlie Pollard is here.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause Congress took an important step yesterday by extending tax relief for working families.
applause When you read the opinions of the white scientists about the pyramids and the building of the pyramids  they don't make any secret at all over the fact that they marvel over the scientific ability that was in the possession of those people way back then.
applause If you look at what Synergy here in Cincinnati did  they had to trim their work force by 10 percent  and they did it by the beginning of this year without laying off a single  solitary soul.
applause They are fourth-year medical students.
applause $17 000 a year.
applause I've already said that  but if you want this thing to go on -- everybody who wants to live like a Republican needs to vote Democrat this year.
applause He's doing a great job.
applause Well  I am delighted to be here.
applause It's good for our air  it's good for our economy  and it's good for our national security.
applause We're funding the Post-9/11 GI Bill --   -- because we want to give -- we want to give your families the chance to pursue your dreams.
applause For too long  the young of the Middle East have been caught in a web of hatred  not of their own making.
applause Again I say  you can only believe in this if you really believe not only in your own potential  but the potential of every other American.
applause The longest one in our national history  so far  was 58 months  so that gives us a little less than 4 months to go till we break the record.
applause We didn't come this far to put things off  or to play it safe  or to take the easy road.
applause Let's give her a big hand.
applause And he always said  repeatedly in his speeches  he was always pointing out to folks that it does us no good in this world if we go out and we tell everybody  and we campaign  and we fight against this  and against that  and against the other thing.
applause Let me repeat --   -- Only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans will face higher income tax rates and no one else will.
applause There are some stands that are worth fighting for  and financial regulatory reform is one of those stands --
applause I think it's a mistake.
applause I just had the honor of meeting him.
applause First of all  I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits -- either now or in the future.
applause That's Mr. Chairman is real care.
applause The Abramoff scandal is but the tip of a giant iceberg threatening the integrity of our legislative branch of government.
applause During a helicopter ride above the country  the President saw firsthand how precarious Israel's security situation is.
applause I say to you today that he will be a partner with me working to strengthen the instruments of peace  to strengthen the United Nations  to strengthen the Organization of American States  to build new organizations  confederations  which will strengthen freedom and strengthen peace throughout the world.
applause First of all  Mayor John Williams from Kenai  Alaska.
applause And when she came home after the trip  I drove by the house.
applause Now  you want to deal with yesterday's rhetoric -- and the Republicans say  well  Clinton's liberal  the Democrats are liberal  they love big government -- you got a few questions you can ask them.
applause But as I said a week ago  I say today  those islands are not worth the bones  and I quote Admiral Yarnell  of a single American soldier.
applause Thank you so much.
applause And I don't fight against government spending and government waste and high government regulation and government taxation  as I have done throughout my whole public life  just because I am against government.

applause They were wearing stickers that went for other candidates  but when I stood up to articulate those principles which commit the Republican Party to the defense of our families  and of the moral character founded on Declaration principles that is their great strength  every single person in those audiences was on their feet applauding the truth of what I had to say.

applause Jim does a great job representing the third district  and the President and I greatly value his advice and enjoy working with him in Washington.
applause And I want to thank Christie and Jess and Doug for their love  their support  and their inspiration.
applause But this campaign is about doing something for ordinary Americans.
applause And I believe that's what you want too.
applause It was the right thing to do.
applause That is what os going on.
applause Yet  our national interest involves more than eliminating aggressive threats to our security.
applause Now  what is -- I think -- essential in a President  in that capacity is somebody who has clear vision  who can identify an objective  analyze a problem  listen to advice from various quarters and then make a decision.
applause And today we accept a system that has destroyed our privacy  and that has turned over to the government information that can be abused in order to destroy our lines of supply as a free people.
applause We have been talking about it enough  we have had commissions  we have had white papers --   -- we have had blue ribbons.
applause This is a new kind of war  and we must adjust.
applause I also want to say this -- I'm also proud of the fact that we've had a real relationship -- this has not been a political deal  we haven't 100 percent agreed on everything  we've had a relationship -- it's like being in a family or an organization or anything else.
applause As Commander in Chief  I hereby grant amnesty --   .
applause Some people say it's because our economy is the biggest in the world; that's important and we're going to keep the environment such that we'll continue to expand jobs across America.
applause But we have to do our part.
applause Little did I realize the last time I was here that I would be coming back to this very spot to thank the fine men and women of the West Virginia Guard for helping us fight and win the war against terror.
applause And I thank you for running.
applause There you go.
applause Thank you.
applause There are many Italian Americans who wear our uniform today  brave men and women who have volunteered in the great challenge of the 21st century  which is to protect our country from terrorist attack  and at the same time  spread the great blessings of liberty so that a generation of Americans can grow up in peace.

applause Mortgage rates  interest rates  inflation are all low.
applause This country will not be intimidated.

applause When it was not popular anywhere in the world to worry about poor  beleaguered  abandoned Haiti  Canada was truly a friend of Haiti.
applause On issue after issue -- from national security  to education  to economic growth -- President Bush has led the way in making progress for the American people.
applause He talked about the attacks on his city  and he remembered that day that as the terrible tragedy occurred  at one point  he turned to his police commissioner  Bernie Kerik  and he said  "Thank God George W. Bush is our President."
applause After all  it's your money to begin with.
applause We will not be distracted from the task before us.
applause This must be Bush-Cheney country.
applause But you  the American people  know the truth: We don't have a deficit because we're taxed too little; we have a deficit because the Congress is spending too much.
applause The biggest danger we face today is having nuclear weapons technology fall into the hands of terrorists.
applause And my good friend  Camryn Manheim  not on stage  but interpreting me.
applause I'm getting ready.
applause Thanks to all of you.
applause Let me tell you why I went to Russia and how it affects you.
applause If we're going to build a bridge to the century  we have to keep growing this economy until it reaches every Delta town and every inner-city neighborhood in the United States.
applause The same should be true on the health care front.
applause My friends  in seven weeks from today  you'll get to make a decision about whether to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past  about whether you believe we're all in this together or to use my wife's term  "It Takes A Village" --   -- or whether you think we're on our own.
applause If you have to choose one or the other  we're beat from the start.
applause We will not permit any terrorist group or outlaw regime to threaten us with weapons of mass destruction.
applause Look  folks  you need to tell people -- they want to know why we did well in America  because we brought arithmetic back to Washington.
applause Our economy has been tested these past three-and-a-half years  and we have responded with strong  decisive action.
applause And so that's it.
applause And I want to thank everybody here tonight.
applause So the guy hiked over the fence  went up  shook hands with the farmer.
applause I see a strong and great country  but I see a country that must he stronger  I see a powerful country that must be more powerful  I see a people full of vitality and energy  but I see a leadership that has been standing still.
applause If those nine children could walk up those steps 40 years ago  all alone  if their parents could send them into the storm armed only with school books and the righteousness of their cause  then surely together we can build one America -- an America that makes sure no future generation of our children will have to pay for our mistakes with the loss of their innocence.
applause I would like to say a special word of thanks to Jack Lew  Sylvia Mathews  Larry Stein  and Martha Foley for the work that they did on this budget.

applause The people of America and the people of Pakistan are grateful to the efforts of the Warner Robins ALC.
applause That's what the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill is all about.
applause And we all agree  and that's a test  so why are we having this debate and election?
applause And Tom Reynolds is a thoughtful and positive part of that dialogue.
applause I had all kinds of people talking about what's going on in the South and how we're going to get this country into the next century with the American Dream alive  with opportunity and education and hope for every single citizen of this country.
applause Thank you  Alvin Perkins  Wood County Commissioner candidate.
applause Congressman Payne  to all the other dignitaries who are here  let me thank you so much  all of you  for being here.
applause I also appreciate the strong support that NASCAR's drivers and crew members and executives continue to give to our Armed Forces.
applause And there were all these farmers standing around.
applause And it's a testament to the Human Rights Campaign and those who organized and advocated.
applause And lest anyone blame any one party or the other  I would remind you that in 11 of those 12 years the Congress appropriated less money  not more  than the President asked for.
applause This is true of all who served and sacrificed in the struggles of the 20th century.
applause And the role we played in that would not have been possible if it hadn't been for the supporters I had in our party and the Congress  including Senator Akaka.
applause I also want to say that I'm very grateful for the people from Heightman Properties  who made it possible for us to meet inside instead of outside today.
applause And each year  they've gotten better together.
applause We'll also work to end lawsuit abuse because we know it's a lot easier for America's businesses to hire workers if they don't have to hire lawyers.
applause This proposal will over time help to reduce the costs of Medicare that you pay every month.
applause Will you send her there Tuesday?
applause So I say to you  my friends here at home  what I said on that train trip and on that bus trip  which I loved because I got to see all those folks that look just like you  who are just like you  that made this country go  the kind of people the President doesn't often see if he just gets in Air Force One and then jumps in the limo and goes to the event -- you get on a train  you get on a bus and you see the people that make this country go.
applause We're going to be proud to call ourselves Democrats in Mississippi.
applause We did pass the Brady Bill and 100 000 felons  fugitives and stalkers lost their handguns.
applause I wanted to summarize it to this extent.
applause We're a compassionate  decent country  where neighbors care for neighbors.
applause And I was just trying to sort of help the marriage get off to a good start.
applause It's time to give middle and lower income parents the same right wealthier parents have -- to send their child to the school that best meets their needs.
applause To my fellow Israelis  I can say we have in you  Mr. President  a true friend and a true partner.
applause They oppose effective reform of our legal system  and they're against medical liability reform.
applause And I'm sure you got snowmobilers here in northern Minnesota.
applause President Bush and I will continue to defend our society's fundamental rights and values.
applause I thought  if I could just play one time in the Newport Jazz Festival  I would know I had arrived.
applause Fifty bucks includes and insures everybody in your house under 18.
applause We honor their contributions  including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian air lift in history in Bosnia;   -- those who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there.
applause We can't stop every war.
applause It's a lot easier for America's businesses to hire new workers if they don't have to keep hiring lawyers.
applause And all of this should remind us why it's so important to send more Republicans to the United States Senate.
applause They've been knocked -- they've got bumps all over the backs of their heads -- some on top.
applause It involves action and effort  and deep conviction -- a conviction as old as Scripture and present at the founding of our country.
applause We are moving in the right direction.
applause "You have dug us into a hole  with respect to the security of our borders.
applause Today  50 million more men  women and children live in freedom thanks to the United States of America.
applause Technology is a part of that  but so is organization and empowerment  which is something you've taught us again today.
applause The Republicans have been in control of the administration for 8 years.
applause What we need is leadership in America  backed by a united people regardless of party which will keep America strong economically  but above all  strong in her faith  her faith in God  in her ideals and faith in ourselves.
applause I think our brightest days are ahead.
applause Let's make sure that the Supreme Court does not pick the next president and that this president is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court.
applause I ask your help in this campaign.
applause This has been an American achievement.
applause No.
applause But you have to decide.
applause We should give you and every other country with a significant AIDS problem debt relief if the savings is used to put into the health system to stabilize democracy and enable the economy to grow and society to come together.
applause Thank you.
applause And Congressman Elijah Cummings is here to honor them.
applause When they wrote the Constitution  they created the job of Vice President  but they got down to the end of the Constitutional Convention  they realized they hadn't given him any work to do.
applause We had a great time serving together in the House  and he will be sorely missed.
applause That doesn't mean I don't love Vegas.
applause I think that is the test for the sixties.
applause What I want is to see the government work all day every day the way we work when we've got a disaster.
applause There will be no crosses burned at any bus stops in Montgomery.

applause We believe that our nation is "one nation under God."
applause Standing here on Cottrell Field  I want to thank each and every one of you for the vital work you're doing  and for your daily example of skill  and perseverance  and honor.
applause We do not need to deprive good  hardworking families who have children with disabilities of the support that Medicaid gives them.
applause That got interest rates down; that led to huge investment and an explosion in the markets and the country going forward.
applause But this is a strong growing economy  don't let the Democrats tell you otherwise.
applause Steve Chabot of Ohio  Van Hilleary of Tennessee -- thank you both for coming  as well.
applause When I was six  I was attacked by a ram on our farm  and I was darn near killed.
applause They're out there somewhere.
applause It is a great honor --   -- you can see me now?
applause Thank you for coming tonight  and may God bless you all.
applause Thank you  and may God bless America.
applause In time  Iraq will be a democratic nation at the heart of the Middle East.
applause Nothing more proud for me than to see our military liberate a people -- liberate women and children from the clutches of one of the most barbaric regimes in the history of mankind.
applause Thank you.
applause I'm pledged -- I'm pledged to eliminate it totally.
applause Last month alone we made 1 500 raids against terrorists.

applause Thank you.
applause I've had a life blessed with four beautiful children  extraordinary friends and families  who are with me today.

applause But we've got to let these folks know that we heard them  because they're the very people that I ran for president to help.
applause I hope you guys have some great fun today.
applause The Democratic slogans of this century have been Woodrow Wilson's "New Freedom " Franklin Roosevelt's "New Deal " Harry Truman's "Fair Deal " Adlai Stevenson's "New America."

applause The figures for the third quarter show the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.2 percent -- the fastest pace in nearly 20 years.
applause We've got to save some of this money to pay the debt down  get the interest payments down  stabilize our long-term economy and have some money left when all the baby-boomers retire.”   And now I think that was an ethical position.
applause But I want to repeat some of the things I said yesterday.
applause Think how different this country would have been when Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson had to manage our transition from being a rural country of small farmers to an urban country of great cities like this one  which Mayor Menino leads so well today.
applause Now  fortunately  if I'm not mistaken  I recognize Reverend Williams  being here.
applause Not one of the newly admitted nations of Africa voted with us.
applause So thank you everybody.
applause I was confident that they would hear the call for a bold initiative  and they responded.
applause It sounds impossible.
applause To strengthen it even more  we need to protect small business owners and employees from frivolous lawsuits and needless regulation.
applause And that's how I kind of view tax money in Washington.
applause Well  we have restored hope and confidence  faith and courage  and returned them as the birthright of every American.
applause These are mistakes he will not repeat.
applause It's easy for him to say it.
applause Now  this won't solve all of our problems in higher education.
applause Eight out of ten people end up on the federal plan under his vision  and that is the wrong prescription for American families.
applause To Sir Edward Kennedy.
applause There are 600 000 reasons in the people who had a criminal record and couldn't get handguns  and lots of people are alive because of that  because we passed the Brady Bill.
applause They champion the agenda of moral dissolution and corruption.
applause Early in my public service  I took up the issue of nuclear arms control and nuclear weapons because nothing is more fundamental than protecting our national security.
applause Seriously  Senator Kerry's prescription -- giving up and setting a hard deadline -- is a terrible idea  and the Senate was correct in knocking it down yesterday.
applause It was wonderful.
applause Consumers are confident  businesses are investing  and families are taking home more of what they earn.
applause And the President asked me to bring you his best wishes this morning -- from the President of the United States.
applause You know  people oftentimes ask me what can they do to help fight in the war against terror.
applause We will always go the extra mile to negotiate  We will always make over every proposal and take every initiative  as President Eisenhower did  on disarmament  on open skies  on the use of outer space for peaceful purposes in his U.N. speech.
applause I'm just a warm-up act for Allan Meltzer.
applause I believe that we ought to make at least two years of college after high school just as universal as a high school education is today.
applause And it's that perception of weakness that generated or contributed to that environment in --
applause I have served this country for 18 years  4 years in the service and 14 years in the Congress.
applause I've done it all my life.
applause There is no more important friend and ally of the President's and mine than the Speaker.
applause Yet they knew the stakes of the fight they had been in  and the magnitude of what they had achieved.
applause The price of freedom is sometimes high.
applause A lot of you have got relatives who wear the nation's uniform.
applause We did not come this far by lowering our sights or scaling back our dreams.
applause They will play the Adagio movement from Brahms' Sonata for Violin and Piano in D minor  Op.
applause That's the strength of America.
applause I welcome their willingness to engage constructively in the reform debate.
applause ... former Governor Jim Blanchard  my longtime friend and advocate for working men and women.

applause The only two countries in Africa to vote with us were Liberia and the Union of South Africa.
applause A few nights ago  I was up tossing and turning  trying to figure out exactly what to say.
applause Ladies and gentlemen  Yo-Yo Ma and Dr. Condoleezza Rice.
applause He delivered.
applause In the House  Mike has been a champion of the men and women of the United States military.
applause We have to pay our way in an interdependent world.
applause And I want to make it clear to the people of South Dakota: I trust you  rather than the government  to spend your money.
applause On Election Day  President Bush received more votes than any other candidate in the history of the nation.
applause We can't waste a young scientist  a young engineer  a young lawyer  a young doctor  a young minister  simply because he can't afford to go to college.
applause It will make a huge difference.
applause Okay.
applause And we are here to ask for your vote  and to ask for your help.
applause We will work to enact the President's plan to make the United States less dependent on foreign sources of energy.
applause Sixteen months ago  Iraq was under the control of a dictator.
applause Every American who pays federal income taxes benefited from the tax cuts  and so has our economy.
applause The Mayor of New York City  Michael Bloomberg.
applause I think it's a great idea.
applause And so are the majority of the British people.
applause Well  I am concerned  and I believe that you are concerned  and that this country of ours  which deserves the best from us  cannot possibly in the early revolutionary years of the sixties be led by people who are indifferent to the great problems which sweep across the horizon of the United States.
applause I grew up in a Democratic family thinking that Civil Rights was the most important issue.
applause The enemy that struck on 9/11 is weakened and fractured  yet still lethal and still desperately trying to hit us again.
applause I will never forget visiting Prague in January of 1994 -- the first time I had been there in 24 years -- and walking across the magnificent Charles Bridge with President Havel.
applause Chairman of the DCCC Chris Van Hollen is in the house.
applause I also want to emphasize that in the health security plan that I have proposed to the Congress we provide for increases  not decreases  in medical research and a means to fund those increases in medical research.
applause And that's what this election is about.
applause I want to thank Senator Elizabeth Dole  who is the NRSC Chairman; Congressman Tom Reynolds  the NRCC Chairman.
applause Thank you very much.
applause Yes  we thought of the enterprise zone.
applause And how is very simple.
applause The Republicans say  well  maybe we ought to pay money to extend the unemployment benefits of people who are unemployed  but not a dime to create any jobs.
applause It's very straightforward.
applause But that is not an excuse for saying that guns are the only area of our national life where there will be no prevention.
applause If we're going to do it  it's got to be because we think that we've got a long-term plan that actually makes sense.
applause For the sake of long-term growth and job creation  we need to make tax relief permanent  and practice fiscal restraint in Washington  D.C.
applause We also want to make sure we achieve high academic achievement while maintaining the strong and vibrant tradition of cultural learning.
applause We're working to get healthier food into our schools.
applause To strengthen that recovery we're going to move forward with an aggressive pro-growth agenda.
applause Thank you.
applause It wouldn't have happened without them.
applause You are going to have to find and we are going to have to find 25 000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years in order to provide full employment  and we are going to have to do that at a time when machines are taking the place of men.
applause But these issues  and there are other examples  raise an important question.
applause And although he could not be here today  I want to put in a good word for your Congressman  Steve Pearce.
applause Finally  are we going to do the right thing about going forward together?
applause The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.
applause Thank you very much for coming  Dr. Paige.
applause Not one of the new nations admitted from August on into the United Nations  and there were 15 or so  not one of them voted with us.
applause And I want to particularly acknowledge the young people in the back --   -- because we're really here for you guys today.
applause This is a lot of fun.
applause Members of -- some members of the United States Senate are trying to keep my nominees off the bench by blocking up or down votes.
applause But I would also like to turn the Vice President's attention to Pennsylvania  to Sharon  Pa.
applause When I was in the 10th grade  Ted Kennedy was in the Senate.
applause All of us in Washington have a duty to the people who sent us here.
applause We may need to increase spending for our farmers or additional money to reform Medicare.
applause I want to give the American people a tax deduction for the cost of any college tuition up to $10 000 a year.
applause Thank you  and God bless you all.
applause We will complete the mission for which so many have served and sacrificed.
applause We're not like that."
applause It is a good  a strong bill.
applause I called Senator Edwards to welcome him to the race the other day  and we had a very friendly conversation.
applause Dean was the antiwar candidate and Dean was surging ahead in the polls  and so John Kerry  in order to advance himself in the Democratic primary  turned his back on our troops.
applause It is in our national security interests to do so.
applause That's why  whenever people tell me that an audience doesn't want to hear about abortion  that's the first thing I talk about.
applause Just make the money accountable.
applause It was never going to be the case that suddenly one day in April 1998  there were The Troubles  and the next day there was peace.
applause We will bring business and social entrepreneurs from Muslim-majority countries to the United States and send their American counterparts to learn from your countries.
applause So what I would like to ask you to do is just indulge me one more time for a few minutes and let me make the arguments that I hope you will go out across this district and across this great state  and to your friends beyond the borders of Kentucky and share with them between now and election day why they ought to vote  what the stakes are  and what the consequences are.
applause You'll find many men who are married and have two or three children  walk away from that woman like she didn't even exist  and leave those children in the house without a second thought  without a second thought.
applause In other words  we want to join you in the war against the pandemic of AIDS.
applause Now I'd like to spend a moment  if I may  to introduce my family.
applause It is as well not to dwell too much on the past  but I think it is worth pointing out that the United States has not always done the right thing by Africa.
applause Thank you  Bob  for being here with us.
applause And that allows them to join the children of legal immigrants who are finally able to get health care through the SCHIP program  something that we did very early on in my administration.
applause I want to acknowledge -- I want to make sure I get them in order: Naté; this is Linda; and that is Sonia -- right?
applause So these are some of the things that we have to do.
applause Why?
applause What can we do to maintain the spirit of independence?
applause They put in work.
applause I mean  look around.
applause I think we need to give every hardworking  tax-paying American the same health care security they have already given to us.
applause Thank you.
applause And let me say again how much I appreciated what Tim Roemer said and what Evan Bayh said about that budget battle I had with the Congress.
applause Well  why would we want to build a Congress with that attitude?
applause We are enabling men and women to live with the disease and we are providing care to many of the orphans who are left behind.
applause Home sales are up.
applause God bless you  and God bless America.
applause I love these Republicans who every 4 years say the party doesn't mean anything; what counts is the man.
applause The government goes directly --   -- and pays doctors or nurses.
applause But on the balance  it would be a mistake to bet against the future.
applause By its very nature  freedom must be chosen.
applause So it's not the plan that some on the left supported in the past.
applause We can argue about budgets  but that's not the greatness of America.
applause Just yesterday  our food safety plan took effect  using new science to protect consumers from dangers like E. coli and salmonella.
applause I'm honored to be here at AIPAC  thank you for such a warm welcome.
applause I know it looks like a rich country.
applause Thank you for being here.
applause This is training to become a medical technician  or a health IT worker  or a lab specialist  or a nurse.
applause You understand that God has a special concern for the poor  and that community helpers and healers are doing the most important work of all -- repairing broken lives  bringing love into pockets of hopelessness and despair.
applause We're working to develop a core of well-trained senior mid-level Iraqi officers.
applause It's easy to decide it but it's damn difficult to do it.
applause See  Mick used to coach the University of Texas volleyball team  and I used to work out at the gym there and he used to come over and give me pointers all the time about how to strengthen up and look a little better.
applause These tax cuts have fueled our economy  and they've helped add 5.7 million new jobs since 2003.
applause I think the choice is very clear.
applause Thank you.
applause It makes -- it makes the whole thing mutual -- America sees two John Kerrys.
applause So we must stand with Heather at this important time in our country's history.
applause I appreciate the fact that Cathy  his fine wife  is supporting Ed in this really important mission.
applause We're going to need you to talk to your neighbors and send out the flyers and put up the signs and turn out the vote  and remind people that this message -- the message of this administration is hopeful for every single person who lives in this country.
applause And she'll do you proud there.
applause They chose unwisely.

applause One of the most important commitments that George W. Bush and I made during the 2000 campaign was that our armed forces would be given the resources they need and the respect they deserve  and we have kept our word to the United States military.
applause I want to thank all of you for being here.
applause It is a promise that I reiterated as President.
applause We need to do all these things in a country and in a society that is on the move.
applause Senator Kerry was asked at the time whether he would vote against the President's request.
applause For those of you suffering from PTSD  we're making it a whole lot easier to qualify for VA benefits.
applause He's a man of courage and conviction who knows how to lead America during a time of war.
applause We believe that our nation is "one nation under God."
applause We must demonstrate that we are a strong and vital society  that we are solving our own problems  that we are identified with the fight which is going on against the poverty and disease and illiteracy and ignorance  that in this free country of ours we are our brothers' keeper  and that here in the United States we are building the kind of society which they can build in their own time with our help.
applause And we are going to work hard to make sure that in the years ahead  we draw closer together  we work together  we maintain a spirit of pride in our own heritage  but a genuine partnership for a better future.
applause My expectation is that when you look back on these years  you will see a time in which we put a stop to discrimination against gays and lesbians -- whether in the office or on the battlefield.
applause We can't stop short.
applause And that's the way America ought to work.
applause Now  add it all up  and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years -- less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars  and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration.
applause But that's not what they're doing.
applause I was the only congressman from Wyoming.
applause I'd like to say  too  that my family and our administration feel that we owe a lot to Brownsville.

applause She's a woman of conscience.
applause We need medical liability reform now.
applause And I asked Governor Miller to go up there with me  and there we were  two southern boys sort of ogling the Ivy League.
applause Now  It happened because in 1993 we took the hard decisions to bring down the deficit  bring down interest rates while protecting education and the environment and our research and Medicare and Medicaid.
applause Again  Mr. Mayor  let me say how glad I am to be here.
applause Ever since July  when Secretary Vilsack stopped -- visited here  he has not stopped talking --   -- about his visit here to Pennsylvania.
applause And this facility is a testament to the tremendous success of your company.
applause Congress adjourned --   -- but only after passing the Family and Medical Leave Act; we had a great signing this morning.
applause And that's why I've proposed a tax credit for two years of community college for every American of any age  to go back and get the education and training they need to make the most of their own lives.
applause And I will take some time to come out and shake hands.
applause You work hard.
applause So the reason that this has to be big is to try to fill some of that lost demand.
applause And  Governor O'Malley  thank you for that outstanding rendition of our two national anthems.
applause We knew he was preaching to the saved  and so I thought we ought to take up an offering here.
applause And anyone in the world  including the Arab world  who works and sacrifices for freedom has a loyal friend in the United States of America.
applause I've watched a good mind fast at work  with steel nerves  guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to the worst in us.
applause And I want to thank each and every one of you.
applause That's the message -- you help us get the message out.
applause New for the sake of 'new' means nothing.
applause I don't know whether you're aware or not  but I just returned from New York -- literally minutes ago -- where I addressed the United Nations on what the United States has been attempting to do --   -- well  thank you very much -- what I was trying to do to help move the world closer to an era of lasting peace and freedom and human dignity.
applause And America is deeply grateful.
applause He described the congressmen he met there as "striking to look at  hard to deceive  prompt to act  lions in energy  Americans in strong and general impulse."
applause My answer is the same as I know Randall Cunning-ham's would be: We've only just begun!

applause We face challenges here at home  as well.
applause And it's real nice now.
applause You served our nation in uniform  and you still serve today.
applause Those labs in Washington State and in Ohio and in New Mexico and in California and in Nevada I believe are now a lot safer because of the fire fighters and Harold.
applause We got the economy going again because we worked with the United States Congress to pass historic tax relief  not once  but twice.
applause As always in America's armed forces  the single most important asset we have is the man or woman who steps forward and puts on the uniform of this great nation.
applause God bless you  and thank you for all you've done to bring this happy achievement about.
applause Ninth  and finally  we will apply to the development of our resources the same scientific talents and energies which we have applied to the development of our national defense  inquiring into methods of preventing evaporation  of controlling weather  of retaining snowpacks  above all  of converting salt water to fresh water  for whichever nation wins that race  to develop an economical way of using our seas for plants and human consumption will have done more to win the friendship of people who live in deserts around great oceans than all the sputniks in outer space.
applause Why did Blackmun say there is no guidance  when right there in the Preamble to the Constitution  our posterity is put in its claim to liberty and the blessings of liberty on equal footing with ourselves?
applause Thank you.
applause There is also a grave danger that al Qaeda or other terrorists will join with outlaw regimes that have these weapons to attack their common enemy  the United States of America.
applause He has apologized  and rightly so.
applause They are serving our country with pride  and they are bringing honor to the uniform.
applause But we've still got more work to do  and that's why I'm going to keep fighting to pass comprehensive energy and climate legislation in Washington.
applause My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt.
applause We must not take that course.
applause So that's why I'm here.
applause This  then  is our proposal -- America's new beginning: a program for economic recovery.
applause Yet some of the very Senators who voted to send him to the Iraqi theater tried to pass a resolution opposing the reinforcements.
applause You're going to see a balanced budget  and the experts tell us  that means a 2 percent drop in interest rates right off the bat  2 percent.
applause Also here are the crews of the USS Cape St. George   ; the USS Austin   ; the USS Winston S. Churchill   ; the USS Carter Hall   ; and the attack submarine USS Norfolk.
applause They're weren't open and honest with their employees and shareholders.
applause All right.
applause We want the fact of disarmament rather than the fiction of it which is what the Soviets up to this time have been offering  since they have not offered inspection along with it.
applause I cannot predict how different our messages will be.
applause Thank you all.
applause We're going to talk about health savings accounts in a minute  but this is a way for people to own their own health care and manage their own health care in a way that makes sense for American families and American small businesses.
applause An America that commits to education because the countries that out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow and the best jobs will go to the best educated.
applause I've gone to all 99 counties.
applause We're fighting for employment nondiscrimination legislation and for equal pay for women.
applause Most states don't have it.
applause We've got a couple of special guests here today.
applause Because for too long  our health care system denied coverage to tens of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions -- including Americans with disabilities.
applause On one side of the spectrum there were those at the beginning of this process who wanted to scrap our system of private insurance and replace it with a government-run health care system  like they have in some other countries.
applause In our second term  we'll keep moving forward with a pro-growth  pro-jobs agenda.
applause As long as African American and Hispanic children are more likely than white children to live in poverty  and less likely to attend or graduate from college  we have another bridge to cross.
applause It's a great tribute to your skill and talent.
applause Join hands  disciples of the faith  whatever your race may be.
applause I appreciate General Kamiya for his introduction.
applause We also owe a debt of gratitude to Foreign Minister Moussa and his Egyptian colleagues  and many many others who gave unstinting help to the peace process.
applause I can remember     I can remember when Negroes were just going around  as Ralph has said so often  scratching where they didn't itch and laughing when they were not tickled.
applause And today  we are on the cusp of taking another big step forward towards fulfilling that promise.
applause Steve.
applause One of my priorities as the Governor of Texas was education; one of my priorities as the President is to make sure every child gets educated.
applause For the sake of economic security and for the sake of national security  this nation needs to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil.
applause I ask your help in this campaign  I think it is time we recognized that there are new frontiers to cross in the 1960's and we can cross them.
applause But the most amazing thing about the victory  it seemed like to me  and for a lot of other fans  was you had a fine man  a man you call "The Bus " retire in his home city of Detroit  with the Lombardi Trophy in his arms.
applause And our Governor will be reelected.
applause Every judicial nominee deserves a fair hearing and an up or down vote on the Senate floor.

applause Don't they believe in these things?
applause Ending our dependence on foreign oil  reforming our immigration system  rebuilding the Gulf Coast  and keeping our country safe from terrorism are not easy tasks  but they're absolutely vital goals.
applause I also want to thank the school superintendent  Dr. Lonnie Edwards.
applause They serve their constituents and this nation with dedication and intelligence and compassion and pride.
applause We've had no finer Vice President in the nation's history than Dick Cheney.
applause And we need to have the backbone and the courage to say that we will not let John Ashcroft in the name of the war on terrorism take away our rights  take away our freedoms  take away our liberties; they go to the heart and soul of what we are as a country!
applause This belongs not to one State but to all the people  and  therefore  I think it appropriate that the United States participate in the development of the resources of the Western United States and the resources of the State of California.
applause We need a President who will back our troops 100 percent  and that's exactly what we've got in George W. Bush.
applause I am the first candidate for the Presidency to actively campaign in the State of Alaska.
applause President Bush and I will also continue to defend our society's fundamental rights and values.
applause But if we are moving ahead  if we are going to move ahead with more vision and vigor in this field  Arco today could be testing on an extensive scale advanced reactor concepts for rocket propulsion  space vehicles  and civilian atomic power.
applause The first of those is to attempt to bring up to date those pieces of social legislation passed in the 1930's which still have great significance in the lives of our citizens today  and  therefore  while Franklin Roosevelt could propose in 1935 a 25-cent minimum wage  we proposed in 1960 a $1.25 minimum wage.
applause A good  honorable  decent family man who cares deeply about the people of this state.
applause And I got to thinking about it because I love the community colleges  and as you know  one of the major parts of the budget that I was so proud of fulfilled my commitment to open the doors of college to every American for the first time and to make it possible for us to make the 13th and 14th years of education just as universal by the year 2000 as a high school diploma is today  because we give a $1 500 tax credit for the first two years of college which will cover the average cost of tuition and fees of 90 percent of the community colleges in the country.
applause We have to change that.
applause We'll set a new fee on insurance companies that stand to gain as millions of Americans are able to buy insurance.
applause But as we grieve for the families in Russia and as we mark the third anniversary of September 11th  I believe what's most important is my husband's work to protect our country and to defeat terror around the world.
applause We are very grateful indeed to Mr Haig for his strenuous efforts to seek peace.
applause The terrorists continue to plot and plan against our country and our people.
applause I also wanted you to pray so that I could say that we were all very impressed with the size of the book contract that --   -- that your son got  and we know we can depend upon you to make sure the Church gets its 10 percent of that contract.
applause The agreement reached in Bonn last week means that in 10 days  the international community will have a new partner  an interim government of a new Afghanistan.
applause George often tells crowds that he thinks it's so amazing that Prime Minister Koizumi's father and George's father were sworn enemies in World War II when Japan was our sworn enemy.

applause Give her a big round of applause.
applause Today's Europe would not be possible without them.
applause I told somebody the other day  this projected surplus tickles me.
applause I'm proud of it and I know I am not solely responsible for it.
applause well  that's especially true when I'm reading about local politics in Maryland.
applause High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200 000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.
applause Dad worked for the Soil Conservation Service.
applause President Bush is absolutely determined that we will not be satisfied until every person who wants to work can find a job.
applause You did that and you should be very proud of it.
applause Terrorist attacks are not caused by the use of strength -- they are invited by the perception of weakness.
applause The people who serve in the military are giving their best to this country  and we have the responsibility to give them our full support.
applause That's where I met Lynne; we grew up together; went to high school together; and we'll celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary  come August.
applause We've never had a fight quite like this -- and we have a lot more to do before it's finished.

applause We did not see Operation Consume.
applause Thanks for everything you do.
applause This is the glory of our democracy.
applause We are here today to honor the Cubans and Cuban-Americans who strengthen America with their character and with their enterprise.
applause We are as strong  and as united and as together as I have ever seen this country.

applause Now I am asking Texas to join us in building this country in times of peace.
applause This is the first time those guys have been on the sidelines and I've been on the playing field.
applause These brave men and women deserve better than to have their actions called into question by a political candidate so ambitious  he can't wait for the facts.
applause This Major Michelle Johnson  the United States Air Force.
applause Others will tire and weary; I understand that.
applause So  look  I don't want you guys to get bamboozled.
applause I greatly appreciate the support I've received from many in this room.
applause I just want to reiterate something I said at the town hall meeting earlier.
applause His government is out of business.
applause They got their message.
applause And at a moment when our troops are in harm's way  having been one of those troops  and was remembering what it was like to have a country divided and having lost the legitimacy and the consent of the American people with respect to the war that I fought in.
applause As President Clinton has said  in the Cold War  when our nation needed a bipartisan foreign policy  politics stopped at the water's edge.
applause And we're going to be very proud  all three of us  to carry Pennsylvania for the ticket in 2004.
applause And of course  I also want to recognize Annette Pombo.
applause Fifty million people in those two countries once lived under tyranny  and today  they live in freedom.
applause And the right thing to do was to cut the taxes.
applause Well  strangely enough  I find that that same attitude is developing all over the country today  and I know why.
applause Secondly  I ask you to help us pass this New Markets legislation  and to increase the number of empowerment zones  and to increase the EITC.
applause An air assault on those weapons of mass destruction  the air defense and regime protection forces.
applause Anybody who has lived in this valley since 1945 knows what can be done in the United States.
applause It is time to build a lasting national memorial to World War II in our Nation's Capital.
applause Terrorists  international criminals  drug traffickers show no regard for borders.
applause And then there are people like President Barack Obama --   -- this biracial kid with a funny name from Hawaii of all places --   -- who was taught by his grandparents and his mother that with a good education and hard work  that anything is possible in this country.
applause Thank you for coming.
applause We're going to have a lot of football games today - real competition.
applause In the Iron Range  north of Duluth.
applause You tell President Bush that there's a whole lot of Iowans that'll go if he wants ‘em to.
applause And they did something no team has done in nearly 30 years  which is win four straight  and become the NBA champs.
applause If you want a President who will keep taxes low for families  farmers  and entrepreneurs  send George W. Bush back for four more years.

applause Each of you has a greater impact than you can ever imagine on people that you will only know for a brief time.

applause These are not easy tasks  but they are essential tasks.
applause We are even."
applause They're a huge percentage of most doctors' incomes and they affect the way medicine is practiced  in a way that's almost certainly bad for the patient.
applause And that means that the companies  instead of competing to see who can offer the most confusing products  companies will have to compete the old-fashioned way: by offering the best product.
applause I think this is a somber time for us all.
applause But for the sake of long-term growth and job-creation  we ought to do exactly the opposite of what Senator Kerry proposes: We should make the Bush tax cuts permanent.
applause We must be mindful that people around the world are listening to these discussions.
applause And it reminds us that we  as a people  don't shrink from a challenge.
applause You can count on him  especially in a crisis.
applause We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes.
applause Thank you very much.

applause Three C's you need if you want to control your nation's destiny.

applause The United States will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country.
applause We will find new medicines and new cures not just for cancer but for everything from diabetes to HIV/AIDS.
applause We must continue to raise our voices and our lives if our nation persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam.
applause And because a lot of people still feel uncertain about their jobs and because another million Americans lost their health insurance last year who are in working families --   -- and because millions of Americans are worried about their pensions.
applause But just a week from now  Haiti will hold presidential elections which will freely transfer power from one democratically-elected president to another for the very first time in the nation's history.
applause Thank you  Congressmen  for your commitment to New Hampshire children.
applause And that's what I'm prepared to do.
applause It's ingrained in our soul.
applause And finally  let me say thanks to all our of veterans in the audience here today -- whenever they served.
applause And I still remember that day because it was the picture of what America is about.
applause They make thousands of phone calls.
applause I thank her for her introduction  I thank her for her service to this state.
applause This great Nation will endure  as it has endured  will revive and will prosper.
applause and against it.

applause These good folks are defending our country.
applause We've got the 51st Fighter Wing.
applause Thank you.
applause We need your support to make sure America benefits from the President's leadership for four more years.
applause We have seen it as Americans have reassessed priorities -- parents spending more time with their children  and many people spending more time in prayer and in houses of worship.
applause In 1993  Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to raise their children in poverty  and to encourage people to move from welfare to work.
applause That is why  my friends  that is why the President of the United States has been correct in being firm in dealing with Mr. Khrushchev and not belligerent.
applause This group of senators needs to stop playing politics with American justice.
applause Where's Brent?
applause He's a member of my Cabinet.
applause Ernie Fletcher stood right by my side  making sure our troops  our brave troops  got the best training  the best pay and the best possible equipment.
applause We wanted to get on with the opportunities for reform and to get by some of the debates that  for all too long  had led to deadlock in Washington.
applause So I ask you to go out here in the remaining days of this election -- we've got several weeks -- and  first of all  send a message to Congress that you're tired of the partisan politics and you'd like to be considered first; you'd like for people to think abut everybody outside of Washington  not everybody inside of Washington.
applause Indeed  we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson  who said: "I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power  and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be."
applause Will you tell me one single piece of progressive legislation ever suggested by the Republican Party in the last 25 years?
applause The surplus is the people's money  and we ought to trust the people with their own money.
applause Both the Senate and House have passed an energy bill.
applause They even had a mirror outside for me to be able to tie it in a straight and appropriate fashion.
applause Please stand up.

applause He has led with confidence  with clear vision  and unwavering purpose.
applause And Carol Moseley-Braun played a major role in bringing that about and she deserves your support because of it and I hope you will give it to her.
applause But I'm delighted to be here  back in Iowa today.
applause I'm told that one of the pilots here  a fellow named Randy  was asked if anyone at Travis had personal connections to any of the victims of the attacks on September the 11th.
applause The collection of killers is trying to shake the will of the United States of America and the civilized world.
applause I want to thank the Chairman  and I want to thank the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for coming  as well  Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch.
applause We've got another big calling here  too  and that's the homeland security for our country.
applause So I vetoed it.
applause But come on  we're not -- we are not going to get relief by turning back to the very same policies that for the last eight years doubled the national debt and threw our economy into a tailspin.
applause We thought it would be a terrible burden.
applause Mr. President  it cannot be the police alone who are on duty.
applause Your Commander-in-Chief is proud of you.
applause I wonder when he put his finger in Mr. Khrushchev's nose whether he was saying  which he said on that interview  "I know you are ahead of us in rockets  Mr. Khrushchev  but we are ahead of you in color television."
applause These men and women  last seen doing their duty  brought great credit to the uniform and to the flag -- and our nation will honor their names forever.
applause Well  Governor  thank you very much.
applause I understand it takes time for legislation to work through the halls of Congress  and you need to understand that  too.
applause Ever since I made that statement I have not received one single cent from my father.
applause But they give you no guarantees.
applause They also demonstrate something about the character of our President.
applause And that's the thing you've got to bear in mind.
applause I think it's fun to be a mayor these days  isn't it?
applause So folks here organized their own boycott of department stores that refused to serve African Americans.
applause In the Iraqi theater  Coast Guard cutters and patrol boats and buoy tenders  and over a thousand of your finest active duty and reserve members protected key ports and oil platforms  detained Iraqi prisoners of war  and helped speed the delivery of relief supplies to the Iraqi people.
applause You've got three great advocates for the steel industry and its workers in those three elected officials who took time out of their day to be here.
applause They'd say  "I'm ready to go."
applause This is only one of the issues which separate our two parties  agriculture  full employment  education  development of our resources  care for the aged  a higher minimum wage  an economy that is moving  a country that is moving  a country which stands for vitality and energy and strength.
applause Ladies and gentlemen  I thank you for being here tonight.

applause I was honored that Dr. Hooks took time to visit with me.
applause I've known Rod a long time.
applause And I'm proud of our Vice President.
applause Either we move with new leadership  new programs  and a new spirit of education  or we stand still and therefore we fall back.
applause I think there is a great place and a major place for private responsibility and for individual enterprise.
applause And  Mr. President  Secretary Duncan  I know you will join all of us in finding the courage  the strength  and the wisdom to teach all people how to read a child's story.
applause That is very important.
applause And Representative Henry Waxman.
applause We are grateful to them.
applause Today I am proud to announce that  as a part of our budget  we would more than double our support for microenterprise in America.
applause I follow here in 1960 the same trail Harry Truman took in 1948 when he came down this valley and carried California in the 1948 election.
applause Generally when I say that  people groan  and I take it to mean they wish she'd have come and not me.
applause If you feel it is time this country started on the road forward again  on that basis I ask your support for the Democratic Party; I ask you to join us.
applause And it worked  we put police on the streets.
applause I don't want to make another point and make a whole other speech  but don't ever forget that we're not going to be able to get business to go into  or to stay in areas where people don't have the education and skills to do the jobs that are needed.
applause And we're grateful as well for the friendship and support of other Asian allies.
applause To all the airmen and soldiers behind me -- you guys make a pretty good photo op.
applause I'm really proud of Laura.
applause There are no better workers than American workers.
applause And with Charles's support  we will work for medical liability reform because America's doctors should be able to spend their time healing patients  not fighting off frivolous lawsuits.
applause Thank you.
applause We ought to trust the people with their own money  and we ought to trust the people of America to provide the compassion necessary to make sure this great land fulfills its promise for every citizen who is lucky enough to be an American citizen.
applause But we are both --that's all right.

applause We should be proud of it.

applause Welcome.
applause Earlier today  I met in New York with Prime Minister Sharon and the Ambassador.
applause I am profoundly touched by your prayers  your friendship and your support.
applause We've been through a lot together.
applause And the caps in proposed legislation before Congress are too high  and will drive up the costs of health care in America.
applause But the lesson of Afghanistan -- the lesson of Afghanistan should remind us we've got a greater force at our disposal than just our military  and that is our belief in the ability of freedom to change societies.
applause We ought to do that as well and encourage people go forward.
applause This is just fabulous.
applause Number one  we're going to say people ought to be able to take off their tax bill dollar-for-dollar the cost of a typical community college tuition so we can make two years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today by the year 2000.
applause But a President -?
applause She served in the United States Navy  as did her late husband Robert.

applause White people and black people are going to vote together in the South and they're going to vote Democratic just like they did when Franklin Roosevelt was president  when Harry Truman was president.

applause That's why we're trying to make it easier for workers to save for retirement and fighting the efforts of some in the other party to privatize Social Security -- because as long as I'm President  no one is going to take the retirement savings of a generation of Americans and hand it over to Wall Street.
applause Last year  that number was $4 billion.
applause And I know the results will be close  like they were last time.
applause When it comes to completing our conservative revolution  I'll just quote an earlier American and say  "We have not yet begun to fight."
applause The President and I will not be satisfied until every American who wants to work can find a job.
applause Will you do it?
applause I don't.
applause Whatever part of the country they come from  whatever group that they may be a part of  there is one issue that they are thinking of above everything else  and that is which of the two candidates for the Presidency  which of the two candidates for the Vice-Presidency  can best give America and the free world the leadership that will keep the peace without surrender and extend freedom throughout the world.

applause And on June 30th  Iraqi sovereignty will be placed in Iraqi hands.
applause And the 11th Air Force.

applause In the months and years ahead...
applause Secondly  can a European economy for peace not signify the most effective economic and political support for the nations of the Third World in their quest for self-determination and dignity?

applause We passed the Patriot Act to give law enforcement the tools they need to track down terrorists.
applause He is working through the United Nations  working through the United Nations and supporting them  so that this newly independent country with such great hopes can keep its freedom  and keep its independence.
applause And he was ungracious enough to come take it away from me  just because he won it and I didn't.
applause And I say  my friends  our leadership is the best way because we've proved it and we've proved it in a number of ways.
applause Congressman Tom Petri from Wisconsin is with us -- two key members on the committee.
applause I want to thank Senator Bennett Johnston and to tell you that I will miss him a great deal.
applause It probably gave you a special delight to be able to beat your arch rival  Duke.

applause America is fortunate to have you -- your service on behalf of all of us.
applause So I said  how low can unemployment get on a sustained basis without inflation.
applause The entrepreneurial spirit is strong.
applause Last week I went to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation where the Oglala Sioux live.
applause God bless you.
applause My friends  the differences between the President and his opponent are as sharp as they can possibly be  and the consequences for the country are enormous.
applause He took the roll call sheet  had it framed  had my name circled in red  and literally -- literally -- had it screwed to the ornate doorframe in his office then as the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
applause We want more nations to see ethnic and religious diversity as a source of strength.

applause I want to say that I'm glad that her children  David and Ann  are here  and I'm sorry the Judge couldn't come.
applause Thank you.
applause We propose to give every student who will work hard and maintain decent grades access to two years of education after high school by simply letting you deduct dollar for dollar the cost of the typical community college tuition from your tax bill.
applause But there is all of us  friends  who have something serious at hand--those of us to whom liberty is not a mere shadow--and found to be celebrated on the 4th of July  and to be celebrated with fire crackers--that we will not only speak for it  but die for it if necessary.
applause He never waivers when it comes to doing the right thing.

applause This is an important election.
applause You're living in a remarkable period.
applause Thank you  General McCaffrey  for agreeing to serve your country one more time.
applause I have come to realize that ordinary folks can have a big influence on the process in Washington  D.C. That ours is a responsive democracy.
applause I don't care where the theater is  how long it takes  this mighty nation is going to track them down until we can say with certainty  our children and our grandchildren are free.
applause I think we can reinsure a young man's education or a young woman's education.
applause yes  we must stand up and say  "I'm black   Yes sir     but I'm black and beautiful."

applause I think my job is to confront problems  not pass them on to future Presidents and future Congresses.
applause That's okay.

applause I'm running for president of the United States to hold George W. Bush accountable for making a mockery of the words leave no child behind.
applause I want to thank Amy for her leadership.
applause I appreciate his friendship.
applause But this law is helping to protect our country  by giving law enforcement the same tools they use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime.
applause Very important.
applause We could not have succeeded in these efforts without the help of dozens of countries around the world.
applause We faced a basic decision -- to leave more money with families and businesses  or to take more of the American people's hard earned dollars for the federal government.
applause Our candidates are depending on you  so be sure to get everyone you know to the polls.
applause I want to thank the three members of the United States Congress who stand up here with me today  leaders in this important effort.
applause When I was practicing medicine  if a young lady came to me and she was pregnant  I'd sit with her in her office and the first thing I'd do is try to convince her she ought to tell her folks  'cause I know her folks; I usually treated them too.
applause And joining the ERM will reinforce our own financial discipline against it.
applause Now  part of the reason I like being in Virginia is because there is a tradition here that has been developing  starting with your former governor and now outstanding senator  Mark Warner.
applause Thank them.
applause The position Senator Kerry adopted most recently seems to be that he would not have supported the use of force to remove Saddam Hussein's regime  and that removing Saddam has somehow weakened our national security.
applause He has  in the last several years  been for the No Child Left Behind Act ?- and against it.
applause And I want to thank the Atlanta Braves for helping my foreign policy with Canada to succeed.
applause Now  nobody in the world benefits from stability more than we do.

applause And  I think all Israelis  they'll tell you  Mr. President  toda chaver -- thank you  chaver.
applause She understands that this election is critical to the future of our country.
applause In fact  it is even very clear that our policy at home is to try to solve social problems through military means  just as we have done abroad.
applause It is an opportunity to affirm anew the deep friendship  not only between ourselves but between the British and American peoples; an opportunity to salute all that you have accomplished over these eight years on behalf of this great nation and of free people everywhere; and an opportunity to look ahead to the bright promise of the future.
applause People keep telling me Senator Edwards got picked for his good looks  his charm  because he's sexy and has great hair.
applause I got it right?
applause You planted some seeds  and they came out the next day  and they looked  and nothing's happened!
applause As Senator Moynihan just described  this building is the completion of a challenge issued 37 years ago by President Kennedy.
applause Mika and I have a lot in common.
applause Millions of Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in these plans  which offer them affordable coverage that keeps their out-of-pocket spending for medical care low  and that often provide them with benefits that traditional Medicare does not.
applause So that's the first thing I want you to know.
applause The enemies who struck us are determined and they are resourceful.
applause When we were riding in here  Hillary and Chelsea and I came in in a separate car from Al and Tipper  but we were looking at all the fields along the way  and then we looked at this really beautiful community that you live in.
applause Finally  last year we did something that I was inspired to do by all these wonderful young people from City Year - -- we passed a National Service Program.
applause So we have come a long way.
applause That's our top priority.
applause A lot of tough talk about the importance of taking on Saddam Hussein and dealing with that emerging threat  and then later on -- as Lynne mentioned -- deciding not to support the request for funds to support the troops once they were committed to combat.
applause And then they -- I couldn't believe this.
applause They are going to have to be well educated.
applause And you know  I would really like to help them.
applause And I think we deserve a president who believes in them as much as the workers believe in those possibilities.
applause We lost it 51-49  and if it had gotten 50 votes  then the Vice President could have broken the tie.
applause And I don't want my country to squander the opportunity of a lifetime  the opportunity of a generation to build the future of our dreams for our children.
applause It is estimated that between 14 500 and 17 500 victims of trafficking cross our borders every year.
applause Some of our soldiers and Marines will never be returning to their families.
applause Our work is not done.
applause We will continue to train Iraqis so they can take responsibility for the security of their country  and then our forces will come home with the honor they've earned.
applause And in children's education  parents come first  teachers come second  and federal judges not at all.
applause Governor  great to see you.
applause But I go back on a regular basis.
applause And look how far we've come since then: 17\1/2\ million new jobs  hundreds of thousands of new businesses  a greater proportion of Americans at work than ever before.
applause A thousand complicated rationalizations  but only one simple reason: because the Jews are different  because the Jews are not like them.
applause In his years in Washington  John Kerry has been one of a hundred votes in the United States Senate ?- and fortunately on matters of national security  his views rarely prevailed.
applause But in spite of that  our economy is growing.
applause This country will not rest  we will not tire and we will not stop until this danger to civilization is removed.
applause We passed national service legislation.
applause Some of tomorrow's veterans are in combat in Iraq at this hour.
applause The President and I have been briefed on their progress.
applause When I became President  we had a $290 billion budget deficit.
applause I was thinking about this last week.
applause By computerizing health records  we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes  reduce costs  and improve care.
applause Today  I think the American people can be confident of a better future  a stronger economy  and a nation that is more secure  because of the character and the leadership of our President  George W. Bush.
applause We got the budget into balance.
applause Thanks for coming.
applause I have asked America to fight evil with acts of kindness.
applause Now he has since said that that was because he wanted to meet girls.
applause That's what we've got to do in America today.
applause Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century?
applause Do we want the kind of government where an outstanding individual who's in it for all the right reasons and has a track record of success in making systems work for ordinary people -- are we going to make sure that this guy has a long and outstanding career in Washington?
applause And the danger is that people may not understand it.
applause We need to meet the goal I set last year and graduate more of our students than any other nation by the year 2020.
applause See  what we believe is that freedom is not America's gift to the world; freedom is the Almighty God's gift to each person who lives in this world.
applause And that spoke volumes to the country about where we stood and what we were fighting for and what we wanted to do.
applause And I don't want to stop until every American feels safe in their homes  on their streets  in their schools  in their places of work.
applause It's a beautiful day to talk about the next governor of the state of Kentucky.
applause California is key to this election.
applause And then came September 11th  and it became clear to all of us that we were at war.
applause And we're not stopping.
applause " He has kept us alive and sustained us and brought us to this time."
applause If you walk  for instance  through the events of the last several years--and I know that it's not fashionable anymore to refer to these events.
applause Finally  I want to thank the Cherokee Choir for filling the East Room with such beautiful music.
applause Thank you very much.
applause He attacked the progress we are making and the policies we've implemented.
applause And we can do that.
applause I'm calling you today from Roswell  New Mexico.
applause See  that's a philosophical difference.
applause I come to Maine and ask your help in doing that.
applause And those acts were answered  if at all  on an ad hoc basis with subpoenas  criminal indictments  and the occasional cruise missile.
applause You've got a superb delegation -- Todd Akin  Sam Graves  Jo Ann Emerson  Kenny Hulshof  and Roy Blunt.
applause More than 50 countries are contributing to peace and stability in Iraq today -- including most of the world's major democracies.
applause And so I want to thank Paul Gillmor  from the state of Ohio.
applause You know you can do it  because of the way you have been educated here and the people from whom you have learned and with whom you've learned.
applause There are some people who believe -- we were talking about this before we came out here -- there are some people who believe that the 21st century world  because the Internet will make the globe more interconnected and we will have all kinds of connections with people beyond our borders that we never had before  and  therefore  government will become completely irrelevant to most people's lives.
applause I'm a fellow member.
applause Have we got some Iowans here?
applause All of you workers in a given industry  regardless of your trade or occupation  should belong to one and the same union.
applause Winston Churchill was dismissed as little more than a has-been  who enjoyed scotch a little bit too much  before he took over as Prime Minister and saw Great Britain through its finest hour.
applause We've got schools that are so old and so overcrowded  they literally -- I've been in school buildings where all the power went out when they tried to hook up to the Internet.
applause And we win.
applause I don't know if you're aware of this  but these honorary degrees are apparently pretty hard to come by.
applause And with your help  I have no doubt President Bush and I will be able to welcome him to Washington as your next United States congressman.
applause Last month  I outlined the next steps that I believe we have to take to spur job creation  and the House has already acted on many of these.
applause You have to decide on Tuesday yourselves which candidate  which party  which philosophy  which judgment.
applause And now I have one final honor  and that is to introduce one of our star mentees: the Little Brother of the year  Anthony Saldaña.
applause You still are subject to stereotypes that I think are unfair and unrepresentative  to be kind about it.
applause And so  today  even though you've already given so much  I want to ask you to give one more thing.
applause We are coming back together  and we're moving forward together.
applause Election Day was a day of hope  it was a day of possibility  but it was also a sobering one because we knew even then that we faced an array of challenges that would test us as a country.
applause Congress needs to come together and get a good Medicare bill to my desk.
applause Today  half a world away  America is leading this great coalition of free nations to end a brutal regime and to remove a threat to our society.
applause It's a pleasure  as always  to be with the leaders and the rank-and-file members of the VFW  and the Lady's Auxiliary  under the fine leadership of Linda Meader.
applause And one place we're the best in the world is growing things.
applause We will honor their memory forever.
applause I am committed to making sure that every single American child is a part of the 21st century revolution.
applause Thank you  Jim Langevin  for running for Congress --   -- and for winning.
applause And my friends  whose money is he spending?
applause We have a message.
applause If you take the big seven economies  we have created by far more jobs in America than all the other countries put together -- 10.7 million more than we had four years ago.
applause You do not have to be a Jewish American or an Arab American to know that the children of our country will have a brighter future if there is peace in the Middle East.
applause We passed budget agreements to help maintain spending discipline in Washington.
applause But lately he's been saying he's proud that he and John Edwards voted no  and he explains that his decision was "complicated."
applause We in America are blessed with lives of tremendous liberty: the freedom to govern ourselves and elect our leaders; the freedom to own property; the freedom to educate our children  our boys and our girls; and of course the freedom to think as we please and to worship as we wish.
applause I offered this program for the simple reason that I looked at the performance of this economy and its difficulty in creating jobs.
applause As president  that is my first pledge to you tonight: As president  I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.
applause Our nation is extremely fortunate during these times of testing to have the dedicated service of our men and women in uniform.
applause Is to encourage them to be responsible for the decisions they make in life --   -- is to make sure that every child  regardless of how he or she are born  knows somebody cares for them  somebody loves them.
applause It's the right thing to do.
applause The purpose was to sow the seeds of dissension in our ranks; to have it appear that we were divided among ourselves; that we were pitted against each other  to our mutual undoing.
applause And we are starting right tonight.
applause We have armies where the infection rate is 30 to 40 percent  where a country can collapse on us  people that we believe in that we're trying to help.
applause So much has changed in the last 100 years.
applause Thank you for all the work you're going to do to make sure Ron Lewis is reelected to the United States Congress on November 7th.
applause And I want to thank the people of Mexico for the warmth with which I've been received  especially the young people who are here today.
applause I think every time we want some young people there  we're like  “Call Duke Ellington!”   And that includes performing at my husband's inauguration  where your Show Choir brought down the house yet again.
applause We have some passionate and dedicated teachers.
applause Their love of our country  and of liberty  never wavers - and neither does their belief in our cause.
applause In Iraq  this administration has consistently overpromised and underperformed.
applause We have made a substantial start at building the kind of America that will be strong in the 21st century.
applause And I was that congressman for 10 years.
applause And they succeeded.
applause It is time for these settlements to stop.
applause They know what they're for.
applause Thank you.
applause Iraqis with firsthand knowledge of these programs  including several top officials who have come forward recently -- some voluntarily --   -- others not --   -- are beginning to cooperate  are beginning to let us know what the facts were on the ground.
applause That's all right.

applause But we also have to invest in people and technology and jobs.
applause Thank you.

applause These numbers confirm that the American people are using their money far better than the government would have  and that Congress was absolutely right to let them keep it.
applause And  of course  no challenge is more critical than the situation we confront in Iraq.
applause Please have a seat.
applause That's what I believe.
applause Our appeal is both wider and deeper; and we appeal today to those instincts and principles which are common to decent men and women  whatever their income  or age  or status  irrespective of their creed  or colour  or race  irrespective indeed of whether they have voted for us or against us in the past.
applause It means extending and increasing opportunities for 180 million free American citizens to make their maximum contribution to progress in this country.

applause And we have together made a difference partly because we decided we were going to do what we were doing together.
applause And small business owners received tax relief.
applause Go home.
applause The clearest  most important difference in this campaign is simple to state: President Bush understands the war on terror and has a strategy for winning it; Senator Kerry does not.
applause He has a record of leadership.
applause Listen  if he had been President and had done that  Khrushchev would have beaten him to a pulp and America's prestige would have really gone down - you can be sure of that.
applause The little that I am  the little that I am hoping to be  I owe to the Socialist movement.
applause You just made my day.

applause You know  we have a saying in America that those of us in politics want everyone to believe: we were born in a very rural cabin that we built ourselves.
applause Nothing.
applause Tim.
applause I think one of the smartest things we did was cut the taxes  to get people their money back.
applause But my job also is to call upon the spirit of this country  is to say to the moms and dads of America  your most important job is to love your children with all your heart and all your soul.
applause Because we're in a situation  aren't we  where we have been through several years  and we faced during those several years a failure and betrayal of moral stewardship at the highest level in our nation's life.

applause For years  they did nothing about the fact that too many women aren't paid as much as men for doing the same work.
applause Thank you.
applause So I've offered the Congress a plan which would say you can have your federal money for education  but if you want it you've got to have a plan to hold schools accountable for the performance of their students  to turn around failing schools or shut them down  but we're not going to blame the kids for the failures of the system.
applause This nation has made a decision: We will engage the enemy; facing him with our military today in Afghanistan and Iraq  so we do not have to face him with armies of firefighters  police  and medical personnel on the streets of our own cities.
applause So the Taliban is out of business.

applause Mr. President  my last 24 hours have been filled with an immensely gratifying number of thank yous  from people who have used this conference to advance their work in fighting global warming and to educate themselves on this topic.

applause It's about every child who will grow up thinking to him or herself  if Sonia Sotomayor can make it  then maybe I can  too.

applause That is wrong.
applause I believe we should keep going until we find a way to guarantee health care rights to all Americans who are willing to work and do the right thing  or who need help because they can't.
applause In the weeks following the terrorist attacks of 9/11  people in every part of the country  regardless of party  took comfort and pride in the conduct of our President.
applause What the Democrats are doing -- filibustering judges -- is simply outrageous  and that's another very good reason to send George Voinovich back to the United States Senate.
applause The Senate looks like they want to micromanage how we can run the Department of Homeland Security.
applause You do it  and others should  too.
applause It is never this quiet outside.

applause Thank you very much.
applause And after that conference  President Eisenhower was criticized by some on the ground that he didn't do as much as he could to save it  that maybe he might have saved the conference so that we could go ahead and talk with Mr. Khrushchev by expressing regrets or apologizing for those flights.
applause And if people are not secure in America they are not fully free.

applause Today  I ask the members of the Congress to work with me  without regard to party  to pass a juvenile crime bill that will help us to work toward year in and year out fewer and fewer people to honor here  until there is no one new to add to the wall.
applause America must never be in a position where her President goes to an international conference and where the man on the other side of the conference table can look him in the eye and say  in effect  "We are stronger than you are."
applause Four years ago  when our economy needed a jumpstart  my husband said that he would reduce taxes and he kept his word.
applause The three Rs of the AFT -- responsibility  respect  results -- that's what school discipline is all about.
applause Congratulations.
applause In Iraq  America and our allies rid the Iraqi people of a murderous dictator  and rid the world of a gathering threat to our peace and security.
applause That's a priority of mine.
applause Well  I think Dr. Koop's problem is that he has had excessive exposure of 50 years of medical practice and reading medical journals and having evidence and facts  and he is not clouded by the political pressure that can be put on by the interest groups on the other side.

applause If you support your parents  or if you are parents who are supporting yourselves  before you can get any assistance  you have to indicate that you are medically indigent.

applause Fired up!
applause The battles in Afghanistan and Iraq affected consumer confidence.
applause Congressman Bob Riley.
applause But then they decided they would say no.

applause This is not a question of class warfare.
applause Finally we get it back on the road.
applause And we have Madam Speaker presiding over our House of Representatives.

applause I've put together a superb team of men and women from all walks of life to represent the United States of America.
applause We carried Louisiana.
applause Because the truth is  by far  the vast majority of small businesses -- who  by the way  create 75 percent of the new jobs in America -- they don't pay corporate income taxes  they pay personal income taxes  because they're either sole proprietorships or Subchapter S corporations.
applause And it hasn't always been easy.
applause They said Buchanan's--then we won New Hampshire  and they are going wild up there in Washington right now.

applause He is a live wire.
applause He understands that this election is critical to the future of our country.
applause We're finishing  in other words  with a little sprint  because that is going to win this election on November 8.

applause So  before I go any further  let me say hello to some great teams: the Williamstown High School Yellow Jackets  the Parkersburg South Patriots  and  yes  the Parkersburg Big Reds.
applause If you feed a terrorist  if you fund a terrorist  you're a terrorist.
applause After September the 11th  we had to look at the threat in a new light.

applause And to get the economy going again  I have twice led the United States Congress to pass historic tax relief.
applause I'm so glad to be here to talk to you all today about why it's important to reelect President Bush.
applause Half of them live on $2 a day or less; 1.3 billion live on $1 a day or less.
applause Thank you so very much.
applause Governor is here.
applause But by making these investments in foreclosure prevention today  we will save ourselves the costs of foreclosure tomorrow -- costs that are borne not just by families with troubled loans  but by their neighbors and communities and by our economy as a whole.
applause We're moving the insurance companies out of the driver's seat and letting the people and the businesses have more influence.
applause This dream of the centuries is close at hand.
applause I did a little research.
applause Everywhere I go -- I mean  you can't be President anymore unless you understand the concerns of at least 50 different groups.
applause Gifford Pinchot used to say that "we must prefer results to routine."
applause has always fought for the bottom dog.

applause We're glad you're here.
applause Congress must not fear the influence of faith.
applause We are a great nation  we're a wealthy nation.
applause So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping  antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2 600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training.
applause Now  they've decided to vote on this plan today  but for some reason they don't want to send it to my desk.

applause But there's not a lot of people putting money in the system anymore.
applause And the other group of people that we need to thank for their fantastic efforts on behalf of all of us are the men and women of the United States military.
applause Barbara -- I just -- everybody  I just wanted to confirm -- I just wanted to confirm -- I just checked with Barbara  so if anybody else is thinking about starting a chant  Barbara didn't even vote for “Don't Ask  Don't Tell” in the first place  so you know she's going to be in favor of repealing “Don't Ask  Don't Tell.”
applause For people around the world know  Mr. Khrushchev  that while you may learn on occasion to bring a man back from outer space alive  you rarely bring them back from Siberia.
applause We know that it's a lot easier --   It's a lot easier for America's businesses to hire new workers if they don't have to keep hiring lawyers.
applause I'm glad you're here.
applause Every one of you.
applause It is also time for the United States Senate to get about the business of confirming President Bush's judicial nominees.
applause By the time we took office  the economy was sliding into recession.
applause And that is as a way to allow younger workers to more nearly -- or come closer to the promises that have been made  but can't be fulfilled  we should allow younger workers to take some of their own money -- their own payroll taxes -- and set it aside as a personal retirement account.
applause This country is moving forward.
applause Just before you met  a weekly news magazine with wide circulation  featured a section entitled  "Kennedy's Liberal Promises " and described me  and I quote  "as the farthest-out liberal Democrat around " unquote.
applause These are two really good men.
applause I want to thank Congressman Dave Weldon for his kind words this morning  and for being here today.

applause I also want to thank Governor Bob Taft for his help in our campaign  as well as your senators  Mike DeWine and George Voinovich.
applause We are a good  kind-hearted  decent people  and we're showing the world just that in our compassion and our resolve.
applause The fall of that statue in Baghdad marked the end of a nightmare for the Iraqi people  and it marked the start of a new day of freedom.
applause And I know that that's what President Bush is trying to do right now -- that is to make very good friends and democracies out of countries that had been our enemies in the Middle East.
applause But there are a number of other things we need to do  too.
applause He is smart  he knows what he's doing  he's tough  he has good values  he makes good decisions.
applause It was the day of days for me.
applause What they like to talk about is the politics of the vote.
applause People of Pennsylvania and people of the country are not interested in deathbed conversion  election time commitments.
applause President Bush will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of the United States of America.
applause My program is brief: that is to strengthen this country  because what we are in this country speaks far louder than what we say.
applause I pleaded with him.
applause Nobody is playing for second place.
applause I appreciate so much the Sullivan Summit leadership of Hope Sullivan and Carl Masters and  of course  one the great public servants in America  America's history  Andy Young.
applause The Department of Homeland Security is part of that effort  representing the largest reorganization of the federal government since Harry Truman was President in the late 1940s.
applause Not now.
applause We will always seek international support for international efforts  but as President Bush has made very clear  there is a difference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few.
applause But these are traps.
applause That would be presumptuous  but I can say something about the experience of the man who will visit this city next Tuesday  and I know you will be out to see him  my running mate.
applause Well  tomorrow  because I'm also the President and I have broad executive authority  I get home at 10:00 p.m. tonight  we're all dog-tired  but I've got to get up and go to work tomorrow because I have to do something that every president has been doing since the 1920s.
applause And it's because of you.
applause The last Labour Prime Minister.
applause It won't work.
applause You've achieved a standard of academic excellence that is without question  tying the record for the most post-graduate scholarships of any class in West Point history.

applause Income for the typical families up about $1 600 in the last two years  our air is cleaner  our drinking water is safer.

applause When I think of all the campaigning that Lynne and I have done this year  and we've been in 48 states and we've covered  obviously  a lot of Iowa  and a lot of other states  as well  too  but I don't know of a single individual in the United States Congress who has made as many appearances with us as Chuck has.
applause We ought to have middle-class tax relief for long-term care  for child care  and to help all families pay for a college education.

applause We've launched a procurement reform effort that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and will save $40 billion.
applause And I want to say that I think the President was right in the way that he handled it with dignity and courage  rather than tossing insult with insult   because I've had a little experience in talking with Mr. Khrushchev  even if it was just in the kitchen.
applause In Iraq  the cruelty of a few has brought discredit to their uniform and embarrassment to our country.
applause We believe that the First Lady is right  that it does take a village to raise children  to build an economy  to build a country.
applause Now  let me repeat: We cut taxes.
applause And the only way we're going to do well is if we all tack the same Constitution up on the wall  the same Bill of Rights on the wall  and say that's what we're going to live by; and if you will stand up and work hard and obey the law and share the same constitutional values and say we're all going to be responsible and do our best and work together  this country is going to do fine.
applause These brave men and women deserve better than to have their actions called into question by a political candidate who is so ambitious  he can't wait for the facts.
applause Good for you.
applause I want to say a special word of thanks to your two United States senators -- first  to John Kerry for his steadfast leadership to try to help us pass a crime bill in the United States Congress that is both tough and smart  that gives our young people something to say yes to while we're being tougher on crime  that takes assault weapons off the street and puts policemen on the beat and gives our kids a better future.
applause I have been on main streets  in cafes  in people's homes.
applause I'd like to thank you  Mr. President  for the hospitality you and your government have given to me  to my family  and to my party on this memorable visit.
applause These ties have made us natural allies  and these ties will never be broken.
applause There is this vast attack today on the idea of government  and all the surveys show that our adversaries are making gains basically because they're trying to make people cynical and negative  to convince them that government is the cause of all of our problems  it is inherently bad  and that it doesn't matter how outrageous they are  what ridiculous things they say  you ought to vote for them anyway because they'll bring the government down.
applause The people now on duty in that part of the world  our men and women in uniform  have done an absolutely outstanding job for all of us.
applause They want to achieve certain objectives.
applause We will work to end lawsuit abuse.
applause If you look at California  you see a picture of tomorrow's America.
applause Because we acted  the people of Iraq are free from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.
applause And this would not have been possible  none of this would have been possible without the strong communities that we have here  founded as they are on Christian values.
applause That will require hard choices and leadership by Israelis  Palestinians  and their Arab neighbors.
applause We have more high-wage jobs this year than in the previous five years combined.
applause That's point number one.
applause They've had it long enough.
applause We heard you.
applause One way to help our small business owners is to allow association health care plans  where small businesses can pool risk and gain the same bargaining power as big businesses.
applause It also means the economy will slow down.
applause Do you want the main benefits of this surplus we worked so hard for to go to just a few  and do you want to risk the fact that we'll be back in deficits before you know it?
applause I'll tell you what's absolutely necessary.
applause In Iraq  America's military and our allies carried out every mission  and exceeded every expectation.

applause We've been through a lot together these last four years  but today our economy is growing  we're closing the achievement gap in our schools  and America is safer and stronger  thanks to the President's decisive leadership.
applause They know that Russia has an economic growth twice as much as ours.
applause Governor Curry -- that has a good sound  doesn't it?
applause I was just talking to Stephen  and as he indicated  what the Recovery Act did was to help during a bad winter  during a tough time  helped him to keep that business  if not growing  then at least stable.
applause I will never relent in defending America  whatever it takes.

applause We've also had four years of declining welfare rolls.
applause I am taking our case to the American people in the next 2 months because I believe that the American people should decide which direction this country is going to go.
applause I'm also proud to be here with the Gunfighters of Mountain Home Air Force Base.
applause Why don't they do better in this?"
applause They will be grateful because he has brought such great dignity and integrity and honesty to the highest office in this land  always a splendid example to the children of America.
applause Your standards have never wavered.
applause Canada is an old friend.
applause Thank you.
applause Today New Jersey is rightly seen as a State that has made a comeback -- a State of economic growth  but of compassion for its less fortunate citizens; a State of reform and good government; a State where  for millions of Americans  life is good  very good.
applause And let me just recognize one other person.
applause Let me also join Joe and Beth in thanking Fran and Sandra for being so wonderful to us.
applause And that journey doesn't take -- that doesn't start in Washington  D.C.
applause Our nation is extremely fortunate during these times of testing to have the dedicated service of our men and women in uniform.
applause Look  there's not much more I need to say.
applause That's why the efforts of the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education to create a fabric  a seamless fabric of lifelong learning -- whenever people lose their jobs or feel that they're underemployed -- it's terribly important.
applause You can look at the fact we've added 1.7 million new jobs over the course of the last year.
applause And I feel that same spirit on this visit: In the gracious welcome of Prime Minister Hatoyama.
applause Judge Roberts is going to make a great Chief of the Supreme Court.
applause When President Bush and I took office  the economy was sliding toward recession.

applause In January  the people of Iraq will vote  as well.
applause I particularly want to thank the Attorney General of the United States  Alberto Gonzales  for joining us.

applause By leaving more money in the economy  tax relief has also helped more Americans find new jobs.
applause You led the nation here with the fastest recent growth in export trade.

applause But Senator Kerry's liveliest disagreement is with himself.
applause It's a great privilege to appear on the platform with my friend  Fred Seaton  who is traveling with us as an adviser  and that means we have a good Nebraska mind working with us on some of these major problems that we have.
applause They also demonstrate something about the character of our President.
applause That proves that American prestige is high in the world  and I would add this further point.

applause I appreciate your governor leading on this issue.
applause I know Dan Farrell  Rita Tamarius  Gary Westley.
applause Representative Barney Frank.
applause I believe -- and I think I have some credibility in saying this now since I lived in a state and governed a state for a dozen years with  I think  the toughest budget mechanism in the country  and since we now have adopted one tough budget  bringing the deficit down and if this budget is adopted  our administration will be the first since Harry Truman's to have three consecutive declines in the deficit -- I think I can say that I think this balanced budget amendment is not a good idea for the United States.
applause We will stay on offense  and we will prevail over the terrorists.
applause God bless you.
applause As the man who ended one war  who kept America out of other wars  and who has kept the peace without surrender for America today.
applause Senator Kerry denounces American action when other countries don't approve -- as if the whole object of our foreign policy were to please a few persistent critics.

applause The only thing I have to say to that is  I'm Dick Cheney and I approve this message.

applause To accomplish them  we must have serious national conversations  conducted with civility and respect.
applause Thanks so much.
applause Now that is how I begin and so if I may turn   if I should turn to the problem itself  these are the things that I have learned.
applause But I want you to think about something in this presidential race.
applause Taught by a free citizen  in defiance of Virginia law  the students were escaped slaves from nearby plantations  who had fled to the fort seeking asylum.
applause This week we all watched and wondered as a former prisoner stood shoulder to shoulder with his former guards to become a president of a free and democratic South Africa.
applause Hey  guys.
applause It's great to be in Pottsville.
applause End quote.
applause And that's what the Patient's Bill of Rights is all about.
applause And I was privileged to be right there at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center the day he raised his right hand and took the oath of citizenship.
applause Thank you very much.
applause Tax cuts started this economic recovery  to strengthen it even more  we need to protect small business owners and employees from frivolous lawsuits and needless regulation.
applause But the truth of the matter is  the role of government is not to create wealth  but an environment in which the entrepreneur and small business owner can flourish in America.
applause And I want to thank Luther Vandross.
applause And like your ancestors  your greatest power is the ability to inspire a new generation of women and girls.
applause One of the things that we know is that there are some things that work  and you live it here every day.
applause Thank you very much.

applause This is a -- actually  kind of tough day for me to give a speech.
applause Thank you very much.

applause And today  as we look ahead to this year's election  we believe we've a record of accomplishment to show for our efforts.
applause In 1864  Abraham Lincoln  when awaiting the returns in the election of 1864  finally heard that Ohio had voted for him  and he sent out a word  "Thank God  Ohio has saved the Union."
applause Now  I believe the next president will be called upon to appoint in the next four years between two and four Supreme Court judges; more than a score -- much more -- Court of Appeals judges; and perhaps over 100 federal district court judges.
applause And for the veterans who are with us today  I thank you for your service to our country.
applause There's so much at stake this November  from the direction of our economy to the conduct of the war on terror  and together  we're going to present to the voters a strong record of accomplishment and a clear agenda for the years ahead.
applause That's what they said.
applause Thanks again for what you do.
applause But he would remind us that no country in history has ever been defeated by terrorism  and no serious person thinks we will be.
applause You all  in the last eight years  have taken care of that.
applause That's what we're trying to do.
applause Let the word go forth from this time and place  to friend and foe alike  that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in this century  tempered by war  disciplined by a hard and bitter peace  proud of our ancient heritage  and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed  and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.
applause I liked sports.
applause So thanks  everybody.
applause And so I have worked to create more opportunity for all  to reinforce the principles of responsibility from all  and to create an American community where every person -- without regard to race  color  creed  gender  you name it -- believe they have a place at the American table and in the American future.
applause This is a fabulous land.
applause Thank you  Austin.
applause We are a family.
applause Tonight you said that the politics of lifting people up beats the politics of tearing people down.
applause When they wrote the Constitution  they created the post of Vice President.
applause And I can also announce that the Secretary has sent a letter today asking these hospitals to adopt these changes now -– even before the rule takes effect.
applause You know  that poster was nice during the campaign; we had some fun  but oh  well.
applause And I believe that more trade union members than ever before will support us this time.
applause We still face many challenges in Iraq and in Afghanistan  but we know that the defeat of terror there is vital to the defeat of terror around the world.
applause Your production is up sharply from its low point during the recession; you've rehired the same number workers as were lost earlier; and now you're in a position to expand.
applause I come from a business where getting a hand was the most important thing in life.
applause I just hope that you will continue to work and to urge the federal government to work with you in making progress in these areas.
applause And the young people they are tutoring are gaining a head start on learning that will last a lifetime.
applause I have never loved my country more than I do today.
applause I met this fine  young man down here  Jeffrey Lanes  who had an injury but didn't let it defeat him.
applause Congratulations to all of you.
applause We are dismantling the financial networks that fund terror  and we are going after the terrorists wherever they plot and plan.
applause I don't think that should happen  and so here's what I will do.
applause You and your families are the foundation of America's military readiness.
applause But they're out there in every community and every workplace.
applause We've got a lot more work to do.
applause Thank you very much.
applause Our proposal is different.
applause And we know that successful politicians have families who stand with them and are there for them all the time.
applause You don't know how to drive  you can't have the keys!
applause But a President -- a President -- always casts the deciding vote.
applause We're here today -- we're here today to start to turn that around.
applause I realize  incidentally  that there are people from two congressional districts and I want to say that in Bill Stratton and Wallie Ackerman  we have two men  one already in Congress  the other that ought to be in Congress  and I give them my wholehearted support and I urge your support of them on election day.
applause Only in America do we have 1 500 separate insurance companies writing thousands of different policies  creating mountains of different paperwork and always  always looking for ways not to cover the people who bought their insurance.
applause And we've already demonstrated our commitment to it  at least you have  being out here today.
applause We can keep down inflation.
applause If we have to choose  if parents have to choose between succeeding at home and succeeding at work  we're in trouble  because the most important job of any society is raising children well.
applause I have confidence in this country.
applause And we know from more up-to-date surveys that since the recession intensified last September  the situation has grown worse.
applause And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy.
applause We have an obligation to protect America and the Americans.
applause This is one of the things the President does  is carries a big satchel with all kinds of important stuff in there.
applause The American people want solutions and not empty partisan bickering.
applause And that includes something else -- making sure BP pays for the damages that it has caused --   -- because this isn't just an environmental disaster.
applause You're also putting your name and your reputation on the line each and every day.
applause People are owning homes.
applause Under the President's leadership  we have taken unprecedented steps to protect the American people here at home.
applause And finally  Congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois  who has forged a coalition of more than 70 co-sponsors for a community development financing institution's bill that shares common ground with my initiative.

applause And congratulations  a little belatedly  to the Los Angeles Lakers for winning your 15th -- 15th -- NBA title  and fourth in the past 10 years.
applause Wow!
applause The kind of society we build  the kind of country we maintain  the principles for which we fight identify us with countries around the world.
applause But I have to tell you  you've got the best.
applause As we do the hard work of confronting terror  we can be proud that 50 million more men  women and children now have the chance to live in freedom  thanks to the United States of America and our allies.
applause I love visiting a good sports town.
applause For if there is to be a future for democracy and tolerance in this region  there must be no future for Mr. Milosevic and his policy of ethnic hatred and ethnic cleansing.

applause That's how we got started.
applause But as for me  I am confident that this country will meet challenges.
applause It demands accountability and responsibility from everyone.
applause The Republican Party has opposed every effort that we have made in this century in the administrations of Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman  to advance the welfare of our people.
applause It is democratic  small "d " -- that is  it's open to all  it's flexible  it's oriented toward results  the programs have to be good and relevant; otherwise people don't profit from them when they leave  they're changing all of the time and they represent partnerships between people in business and people in education  and no one asks you what your political party is or what your position is on this  that  or the other issue is.
applause And thanks for being here  Tom.
applause I proposed a targeted tax cut.
applause Thank you very much.

applause For 25 years the Republican Party has opposed every piece of progressive legislation on behalf of the people of this country  and for 14 years Mr. Nixon has been associated with that opposition.
applause And if we will commit ourselves to a few simple things -- educating all of our children and providing education for adults whenever they lose jobs  the moment they lose jobs; making the most of our resources; selling America's products around the world; and taking the things we have in this country  like these military bases  and turning them into opportunities; and if we will commit to say if a person loses a job they at least ought to be able to carry their health insurance and their pension with them so they can take care of their families when they start anew.
applause She is a fabulous First Lady.
applause And few have matched his reach across the aisle -- from working with Birch Bayh to protect Title IX so girls can compete on a level playing field  to sponsoring the Fair Housing Act with Walter Mondale and small business legislation with Ted Kennedy -- one of the many bills he would sponsor with the senior senator from Massachusetts.
applause It is George Bush.
applause But we're pivoting off that theme today  but instead of hearing the beauty of song  we'll witness the glory of movement.
applause We'll be selling them all over the world and Iowa will be better.
applause Now  as Tim can tell you  some of our friends in Washington want to take away the tax cuts by letting them expire.
applause Over the next several weeks we'll announce a new national effort to promote the business link partnerships  pairing big businesses with smaller  often disadvantaged companies  an idea the Vice President has so strongly championed.
applause Thank you  and God bless you.
applause Thank you all for being here.
applause I don't believe that this city and the State of Ohio wants for a President of the United States in 1961  a man who thinks a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour for someone working in interstate commerce is extreme.

applause I know this fight  I am ready for this fight  and we will win this fight.

applause What I would like to tell you is  I think that it is very much in the interest of America to have big  large scale debt relief if the countries that get the relief are committed to  and held accountable to  good governance and using the money not to build up military power  but to invest in the human needs of their people.
applause Now  100 years later  in the election of 1960  we know there is a God  and we know He hates injustice  and we see the storm coming  but if He has a place and a part for us  I believe that we are ready Thank you.
applause As long as there are 15 million Americans who live in substandard housing  5 million American families which lack plumbing of any kind who live in our cities  as long as 9 million of our older citizens receive an income of less than $20 a week  as long as there are millions of Americans who lack the protection of even an inadequate minimum wage of $1  as long as there are millions of Americans who lack an opportunity to develop their full resources  as long as there are 100 000-odd families in the State of West Virginia receiving inadequate surplus food packages  so long as there is need for us to recognize there is unfinished business in our society  in our generation  in our day.
applause They've also started a dance team to help kids stay active in ways that are easy and fun.
applause We had record surpluses.
applause And that's something to be very  very proud of.
applause We've got to quit thinking of this problem in a timid way; we may have to pay more now to get the surpluses off the farmers' backs  surpluses which hold down his in come  pay more now in order that the problem will be less acute later on.
applause They're sole proprietorships.
applause He's a Chicago Cubs fan.
applause And that's one of the principles of this debate.
applause We've got an Iraq interim government in place.
applause The King of Jordan and the Prime Minister of Israel came to Washington to end their war and to pledge to work for peace.
applause Thank you.
applause If you're concerned about the quality of education in your community  you're responsible for doing something about it.
applause And it makes the choice in this election clear: more of the same with President Bush or a new  smarter direction with John Kerry that makes our troops and America safer.
applause But I think we in the government have all been surprised by how much of our time in office has been consumed with international relations.
applause We have for too long been willing to act as if this is the way things are  and this is the way they always will be  while right before our eyes  today  we are already watching the surrender and destruction of our own liberties and the institutions of self-government that embody them.
applause That's where I met Lynne  and we went to high school together  and a couple of weeks ago  celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary.
applause I look forward to continuing to work with him to make civil nuclear cooperation a reality.
applause Because your country is free  you can now go to school for the first time.
applause You get the drift here.
applause And I know that with all these kids coming into this school district  filling these trailers -- now you've had to hire a lot of new teachers.
applause This is a unique time in our history.
applause You hear the voices begin to filter out of their home states.
applause And we've begun the transition to private and secure computerized health records  because this will not only reduce errors and costs -– I know you can't read those doctors' handwriting --   -- it will mean you can spend more time with patients and less time with paperwork.
applause We have built this world without walls.
applause And I admit that America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy.
applause They're in favor of affirmative action if you can dunk the basketball or sink a three-point shot --   -- but they're not in favor of it if you merely have the potential to be a leader of your community and bring people together --   ; to teach people who are hungry for knowledge  to heal families who need medical care.
applause We have to honor our obligations to the environment and to our future.
applause And he'll be  every time somebody wants to do something that doesn't make a lick of sense based on decades of history on the farm  he will be there to remind people to do the right thing by America's farmers.
applause I actually think  though  that whether you look at it from the point of view of political expediency  or from the point of view of what this country requires as we step into the new century ahead  there is  in fact  one overriding issue of importance to this nation's life -- and that is the issue of our allegiance to the moral principles on which our country was founded.
applause I think we ought to stay there  modernize our alliances  and keep the peace so we don't have to fight any more wars in the 21st century.
applause And they seek to destroy more than our institutions of democracy and freedom  like our schools or places of worship.
applause And the Taliban found out what we meant.
applause Your country has prepared you.
applause We never expected to see them closed by strike action for any prolonged period  and the parents said "This won't do.
applause We need to send the message to Republican and Democrat legislators and senators that it is just right.
applause As we travel across the country  I think how much we have to be proud of as Americans.
applause Please  have a seat.
applause And if you have privacy concerns  you ought to know your records will be kept private.
applause I'm so honored to be here with my brother.
applause So with that  let me sign this bill and let's get to work.
applause I came to this office to solve problems  instead of passing them on to future Presidents and future generations.
applause The President is working with many countries in a global effort to end the trade and transfer of these deadly technologies.
applause There he is.
applause Anyone else here from Washington?
applause We care about you  but you have to take care of yourself.
applause I spend a lot of time in community colleges like this one  because I think in many ways  this is the most important institution in American society as we move toward the next century.
applause But in the meantime  there's another extremely important election just eight days away  and there's no doubt in my mind that Haley Barbour is on his way to victory.
applause And we've begun to take historic steps to achieve this goal.
applause Work hard to get this man into office.
applause Three  I believe if the United States is going to speak with vigor and strength abroad  it must not only carry on the struggle against the Communists  but it must also identify itself with the people around the globe against poverty  misery  disease  and ignorance.
applause What's best for all of our businesses?
applause Some of you may have experienced this yourselves.
applause You have given me a memory tonight I will never forget.
applause But we also need to guarantee every American working family the education and training they need  the investment in their communities they need  the security of health care that can never be taken away  and an economic policy dedicated to growing jobs and raising incomes and benefiting the ordinary citizens of this country.
applause There are still people who are discriminated against.
applause Well  thank you  Tom  for that introduction.
applause If I knew I was President then  to think that I'd be inviting them to the White House is hard to take.
applause Governor  Senator Clark  Governor Edmondson  ladies and gentlemen: One of the things about running for the Presidency is that you have to be prepared to make speeches before breakfast and on any other occasion.
applause That's more jobs than Germany  Japan  England  Canada and France added  combined.
applause Al Sharpton --   -- Dr. Benjamin Hooks and Frances are with us.
applause And I know that McClellan and its families are happy about the passage of the defense appropriations bill.
applause But it's important as we think about the election this year  a decision that the American people have to make is: Do we want to pursue that strategy that we think is the right way to go  and that the President has been -- had us all pursuing now for now over three years?
applause and fortunately on matters of national security  his views rarely prevailed.
applause And today  the American people can be confident of a better future  a stronger economy  and greater security against the dangers of our new era because of the character and leadership of our President  George W. Bush.
applause How do they pay their rent?
applause I say that because I think that there is a direct relationship between the efforts that we make here in the sixties  here in the West  here in the State of Wyoming  here in the United States  and what we do around the world.
applause Ours is a political party that understands we need to have people on the bench who understand the difference between legislating and being a good judge.
applause And  therefore  we need to replace aging aircraft  and get ready to be able to defend freedom with the best equipment possible.
applause He trusts the people with their own money.
applause That's more jobs than Germany  Japan  England  Canada  and France added combined.
applause That's what you've helped deliver over the last year.
applause Above all  ladies and gentlemen  we're going to stay focused on our number one obligation: to protect and defend the people of the United States in this time of war.
applause And for those of you who have health insurance --   -- I know that sometimes this seems like  well  is this something we can afford to do.
applause Here's a questioner right down front.
applause And I am working -- we are all working -- for a united society here in Northern Ireland.
applause Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger is here.
applause America's founding documents give us religious liberty in principle; these Americans show us religious liberty in action.
applause We're really glad you're here.
applause Our opponent opposed that.
applause Thank you very much.
applause But I want -- I want you to tell your sons and daughters about what has taken place in an incredibly brief period of time.
applause Not only is the legislation pending  but we know how it can be paid for  which is to stop providing subsidies to banks and financial institutions that are serving as middlemen on student loans.
applause The rise of democracy in that troubled region of the world will be a crucial setback for the terrorists.
applause I believe as strongly as I can say --   --and I want to give Michigan another hand here  at least one of my friends in Michigan -- I got interested in the idea that we ought to make college available to everyone when Governor Blanchard started the Michigan Tuition Savings Plan here.
applause I'm honored you all are here.
applause Finally  I feel particularly privileged to share the stage today with Mrs. Alma Powell  who knows -- she knows a thing or two about service and sacrifice.
applause Thank you  Philadelphia.
applause Under his leadership  we removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and closed down the training camps where terrorists were trained to kill Americans.
applause This is Kate.
applause Journalists  many but not all of them on the Left  were almost daily predicting U turns.
applause We got prayer back in the public schools.
applause We know your country asked you to carry out some very demanding missions.
applause I am committed to these goals.
applause When I became governor I had to resign because all--we contracted all our family planning services through Planned Parenthood in Vermont.
applause Here is a man who has stood up and fought for working people every single day of his life.
applause That's not going to happen because we're going to win this election.
applause Thank you  and God bless you all.
applause I also said that if you harbor a terrorist  if you feed one  if you think they can hide in your land you're just as guilty as the terrorist and the Taliban found out exactly what we meant.
applause It's a lot easier to change a law than to change a human heart.
applause Others in the 3rd Infantry are getting ready to deploy to Kosovo.
applause He went on to say.
applause I ask you to look around you.
applause On the continent of Africa  which I'll be visiting next week  America is now committed to bringing the healing power of medicine to millions of men and women and children now suffering from AIDS.
applause Thank you.
applause And if we get any scintilla of evidence that somebody may try to harm America  we will bring them to justice.
applause Glad to be back in New Mexico.
applause I will do all I can do to deserve your trust.
applause I had just been elected Governor of Texas.
applause There are 18 days until the election.
applause We know that our servicemen and women's sacrifices are their families' sacrifices as well.
applause You are proving that right here in the Hudson Valley.
applause San Antonio and south Texas have produced a number of true American heroes.
applause We trust you.
applause He presents this as if it is the Administration's failure to be engaged in the peace.
applause You're a long way from home.
applause But I am confident that we can do it and with your help and your support we will do it.
applause Today -- today I say this to Mr. Castro: If you are confident your ideas are right  then stop jamming the broadcasts of those whose ideas are different.
applause Some of the same folks in the other party whose policies gave us the economic crisis are now looking for another chance to lead.
applause We're going to create three national parks in the Mojave Desert area of California.
applause I should say that there's also one girl in particular who's just thrilled that all of you are here -- and that is Malia Obama  because this happens to be her birthday  as well.
applause When it comes to providing first-class care for our veterans  we are getting the job done.
applause For the first time since the creation of Medicare  the House and the Senate have passed reforms to increase choices for our seniors and to provide coverage for prescription drugs.
applause But I can tell you  I have been in communities that have had these curfews for a couple of years.
applause They only know the rules of a generation of self-seekers.
applause She told me that she wants to save for her three-year-old child's education  as well.
applause And today I want to formally re-issue an invitation to the people from the entertainment industry involved in television to come back to the White House before the end of July to discuss that.
applause I appreciate my friend Tom Ridge.
applause From kindergarten to graduation  I went to public schools  and I know that they are a key to being sure that every child has a chance to succeed and to rise in the world.
applause All across America right now millions have lost their jobs or are fearful of losing their jobs.
applause I hope  in closing  may I say that all of those of you who are students at this college will consider during your lifetime embarking on a career of public service.
applause When America makes a commitment  America keeps its word.
applause So thank you very  very much for that.
applause Our military is making good progress in Iraq; yet this war is far from over.
applause Well  let's do that again.
applause If you are a -- concerned about the quality of the education in the community in which you live  you're responsible for doing something about it.
applause And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.
applause And Jim Miller stands there  not just for election purposes  but because he has stood there throughout his whole career.
applause That's what the Middle East is about.
applause But then  you know  if you go up and down the country  you will get a tremendous number of people coming to you and saying  ‘Well  we didn't want to go on strike  but we weren't consulted  we weren't consulted at all.'
applause Now  I want to say two other things.
applause I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
applause It gave all of us who aren't young anymore something to look forward to.
applause Now  what about building one America?
applause Nobody but a couple of Democrats wants to change the all-volunteer force because it's the finest military the world has ever known.
applause And Orrin Hatch  another fine senator  is here  as well.
applause I want to thank all the leaders  the generals  the soldiers in the armies of compassion who are here with us today.
applause So  today I want to talk about some steps we can take  the beginning of some important steps.
applause The President has put forward superb nominees to serve on the federal bench -- talented  experienced men and women  who represent the mainstream of American law and American values.
applause She has such grace and such dignity and she lifts us up.
applause We're holding the state sponsors of terror equally responsible for terrorist acts.
applause There's another war at home  too  and that's to win the war against the scourge of drugs.
applause This legislation promotes alternative fuels by offering tax incentives for the use of biomass  wind  and solar power in New Mexico homes.
applause Katherine  thank you for coming.
applause Thank you.
applause Your State Auditor Rebecca Otto is here.
applause When Congresswoman Mezvinsky and her colleagues voted for this economic plan  they voted for your economic future  for lower deficits  higher growth and for better jobs.
applause With a family tradition that's generations strong  the Pettys are about as close as you can get to a NASCAR dynasty.
applause That makes us the United States of America.
applause Please welcome President Barack Obama.
applause You got a “What's happening  First Lady” right here.
applause Terrorists need places to hide  to plot  and to train  so we're holding their allies  the allies of terror to account.

applause Now  I think we are going to have to do better.
applause Charlie said we had a do-nothing Congress.
applause Our Armed Services have performed brilliantly in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
applause Until we proved that in America nothing can withstand the power of millions of voices that are calling for change.
applause America's economy is moving in the right direction.
applause Government must play its part  government must  of course  handle our defense  it must handle the great programs for economic assistance abroad and the like - with which you are familiar - but as far as economic progress generally is concerned we must recognize that government's function primarily must be to stimulate and encourage individual enterprise in our economy.
applause Out of the incredible evil of September the 11th will come some lasting good.

applause We only wish we had more from Texas of his persuasion because we can sure use them down there.
applause Thank you very much.
applause One of the main reasons people give for not volunteering is that no one has asked them to do so.
applause By strength in diplomacy  as I mentioned a moment ago  we need firmness without belligerence.
applause So  that's why I don't go around making promises that I shouldn't keep or wouldn't keep  but that's why I have programs that will move America forward  but will move her forward not simply by saying that we'll turn over everything to the Federal Government  but we'll move her forward by saying that the way to progress in America is not through what Government does primarily  but through what 180 million Americans are encouraged to do for themselves  and that's our difference  and that's our program.
applause The Pentagon has declared our dependence on fossil fuels a security threat.
applause These members are concerned.
applause Speak out about it  it is wrong to remain silent about it.
applause Free debates are important.

applause And when New York took a chance on me and Al Gore in 1992  that's exactly what it was.
applause Together with our Iraqi partners  we must defeat those who oppose the new Iraq.
applause But we acted.
applause And we know that when men and women are given the power to determine their own destiny  the ideologies of violence and resentment will lose their appeal  and nations will turn their energies to the pursuit of peace.
applause The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people.
applause Last year  I was proud to sign new individual development accounts into law  fulfilling a campaign pledge from 1992  and thanks in no small measure to the leadership of Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa and former Senator Dan Coats from Indiana.
applause And they're doing a superb job.
applause She came out.
applause We have spent the last 20 months governing.
applause My faith teaches me that where your treasure is  there your heart will be also.
applause We want better education.
applause And my kids  they get to swing on the swings  climb on the jungle gym.
applause At last a young couple can really budget for the future  knowing how much they have to spend on their home.
applause Second  in no area will innovation be more important than in the development of new technologies to produce  use  and save energy -- which is why my administration has made an unprecedented commitment to developing a 21st century clean energy economy  and why we put a scientist in charge of the Department of Energy.

applause And last week  the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution pledging the U.N.'s help in making the new government a success  and paving the way for free and fair elections in Iraq beginning in the new year.
applause But we accept that premise  we believe it  that the majority of the people  electing whoever they think best to serve their country  in making that judgment you have to make your own conclusion about where your country is and what it needs.
applause Opposed the GATT.
applause That's the message that we have as Republicans.
applause Every day we're seeing the good results of your efforts.
applause The best way to secure our homeland in the long-term  however  is to take this war  wherever a terrorist tries to hide  and get 'em.
applause That was all DLC advocacy.
applause I do think that the Agriculture Department had to be cut  but my view was not to reduce the School Lunch Program  but close 1 200 offices  because we didn't need that many when we had fewer farmers and fewer problems.
applause It's Louis and Fred Ruiz.
applause Millions of Americans turned to prayer for wisdom and resolve  for compassion and courage  and for grace and mercy.
applause Members of our military depend  above all else  on the support of their families -- and I want to thank them  the family members who are with us today.
applause We've got Attorney General Eric Holder.
applause He went on to say the comparison was odious.
applause But let me say again  the lowest African-American unemployment and poverty rates ever recorded  and we've been separating the figures for nearly 30 years now.
applause And you know that's going to be pretty good.
applause I gave fair warning to the government that harbors them in Afghanistan.
applause Jane Lubchenco  who is the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
applause Thank you very much  everybody.
applause When I talked about these fundamental values myself during the campaign of 1980  there was a certain amount of questioning  even criticism.
applause This deficit is $100 billion lower this year than it would have been if we'd left their budgets in place.
applause The long-range implication of that concentration  of that ability to speed up when they thought it was needed  indicates how serious is the competition in which we are now engaged.
applause If kids cannot be safe in school so they can learn and feel secure  where can they be safe?
applause People of Pennsylvania trained him well.
applause I am committed to mobilizing a citizen army of a million people to be trained as tutors and to be willing to tutor children in every community in this country so that by the year 2000 every 8-year-old can pick up a book and say  I can read this book all by myself.

applause In Afghanistan  10 million people registered to vote  nearly half of them women.
applause Dad worked for the Soil Conservation Service.

applause Two-and-a-half years ago  we inherited an economy in recession.
applause But it is an honor to be here today.

applause They want to move ahead again  and we are going to do it beginning January 1961.
applause All the people who have gathered here today  all the auto executives  all our outstanding elected officials and appointees -- Ron Gettlefinger  members of Congress  governors -- all these folks here today have demonstrated that this kind of common effort is possible.

applause Senator Wofford has been working hard on this health care issue ever since he got to the Senate  but you can't change the health care system unless the White House and the Congress are in harness.

applause Thank you for coming.
applause This proposal would make preventive care free so you don't have to pay out-of-pocket for tests to keep you healthy.
applause Thank you  please be seated.
applause There are still a lot of people who are just as smart and hard-working as we are who couldn't afford to be here tonight because they haven't participated in our recovery.
applause And I agree with Rudy  he's being replaced by a really good man  Michael Bloomberg.
applause We can only do that if we deal with one last challenge  which I believe today more than any other thing  is the distinguishing difference between the two parties.
applause Or isn't it better for you to have more take-home pay and decide for yourself how that money will be spent?

applause We need to control the costs of health care by passing medical liability reform.
applause The Indian is in worse shape than we are.
applause I must say to take time out in an intense campaign  which involves his future greatly and which is hard fought in Minnesota  to give up 2 days at this crucial point in the campaign I think first indicates how strongly he believes in this cause and also how great a man he is.

applause As you know  Georgia Tech and Duke have always been great rivals  and sometimes in those 3 years Duke won  sometimes Georgia Tech won (you remember Bill Alexander and Wallace Wade were great rivals as coaches)  but I'll say this - and every Duke man will agree - that a Georgia Tech team was never uninteresting  it was never dull.
applause It's going to be three yards and a cloud of dust.
applause It is about who decides.
applause And let me say a special thanks to all of you who have braved this terrible weather to be here today.
applause About 30 of them said  we really miss you.

applause So what's working fine for them wasn't working for ordinary Americans.
applause Thank you all very much.
applause So we have to do that.
applause Y por fin  Juan Marichal.
applause I don't think that there is any doubt that during the next 4 years the task of the President  the burdens that will be placed upon him  the responsibilities which all Americans must meet  will be heavier than they have been any time since the administration of Abraham Lincoln.
applause That's what we do.
applause Provide tax credits and loan guarantees to companies like Namaste  a company that will be expanding  instead of laying people off  as a result of the plan that I'm about to sign.

applause They should be proud of you; but they should also be proud of themselves.

applause I'll tell you another big idea.
applause That is what has been at risk in these years of Clinton-Gore leadership.
applause That's what works.
applause First  I would say this: Mr. Nixon and I differ very basically on the present position of the United States in the world  on the present position of the American economy  and on what must be done to strengthen our country.
applause And we will associate with them not merely in the struggle against communism  but in the struggle against the disease and ignorance and illiteracy and lack of hope.

applause Nick Edwards and Michael Roberts have been magnificent and Sir Raymond Gower and Ian Grist have played a valiant part  and tonight we have here Michael Clay  Alun Jones  Ralph Tuck and Robert Walter.
applause Four years in a row  we're halfway home on 100 000 police  we stopped them when they tried to repeal the 100 000 police  we took the assault weapons off the street  60 000 felons  fugitives and stalkers didn't get handguns  but all the Washington hunters still have their hunting rifles.
applause And there can be no doubt that George W. Bush is serious about fighting it -- and winning it.

applause We want our children to be safe  and for them to receive the best health care when they're sick.
applause That makes us stronger.
applause But consider the results.
applause But I gave it to a guy who worked for me  because he thought he was going to ride to heaven on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
applause Now  think about this.
applause Thank you both for being here and taking time out of your day to come.

applause I am told this is the first time in history that a national candidate has come to Hawaii so close to Election Day  and I'm proud to hold the distinction.
applause As we like to say in Wyoming --   -- you can put all the lipstick you want on the pig  but at the end of the day it's still a pig.
applause I had to take responsibility.
applause We're working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons  seeking the goal of a safer  more secure world that's free of nuclear weapons.
applause We will defeat them there so we do not have to face them in our own country.
applause The economy in the last half of last year grew at a rate of over 6 percent  one of the highest rates in 20 years.
applause Fourth  and finally  we will expand California's Pinnacles National Monument  created by President Roosevelt in 1908.
applause And I was especially proud that almost all the companies who lost executives on that terrible day sent replacements to go on this mission to finish the work of advancing the cause of peace.
applause Since May of '03  this economy has generated 3.7 million new jobs.
applause Three wars we have fought  and we haven't gotten an acre of territory out of it.
applause That's the America we believe in.
applause People say  to me  "Now  Mr. Nixon  we read in the paper yesterday that your opponent says we're going to have a recession."
applause Their mission is like others we have given to past generations in our military: to defeat the violent and rescue the innocent.
applause We will provide everything you need to carry out the missions that are given to you.
applause That's president pro tem -- and Joshua Griffin  the secretary of the senate.
applause One of my first jobs was at the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland  and as a copy boy I joined the American Newspaper Guild.
applause They've got one weapon  by the way -- their ideology is so dark  nobody believes in it except for a handful  but they've got the capacity to kill innocent people and have those images on the TV screens around the world  all attempting to shake our will and to get us to retreat.
applause Now  this has been a great day for me  and last night was a great night when we started our convention.

applause He's steady as a rock  a man of his word  with a capacity for greatness equal to the challenge of his office.
applause And children with disabilities are no exception.
applause And members of my Cabinet here  presidents of other universities here  and other distinguished American citizens  all of whom have labored in the vineyard that produced Martin Luther King.
applause Since we adopted the Brady Bill  last year  1994  there were 40 000 felons who did not get handguns and didn't have a chance to shoot innocent Americans because of it.
applause It was cruel.
applause I always wear a flag pin  but I was afraid he'd be looking down today because every time I'd wear the flag pin on the floor  he would grab me  take my pin  and put on a Constitution pin.
applause Second  democracy must have prosperity.
applause Let me just say this.
applause John  you will carry with you America's hopes.
applause And I ask you to consider just two things as I move out of this and leave you here and go back to work.
applause The President of the United States must be clear and consistent.
applause Our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values.
applause And I want to thank the veterans who are here who have set such a great example.
applause He will attack the Patriot Act -- after he voted for it.
applause She said  "I'm for you  and I wish you'd tell those people back there with their signs if they feel so strongly about it  come help me adopt these babies and stand up for their right to grow up and live a good life."
applause It's time we found alternatives to imprisonment for young people and kept the people behind bars who should stay there.
applause You are "always ready" to rescue those in trouble.
applause We need a president who will bring America back.
applause And today  I'm so happy to welcome three new allies to the Bush-Cheney team.
applause Thank you very much.
applause Your service makes a difference for a nation at war and improves the chances that one day we'll be a world at peace.
applause There can't be any more something for nothing.
applause I had the high honor of going before the Congress for my State of the Union address.
applause The next Conservative Government will implement our proposals and thus establish the foundations of lasting racial harmony and tolerance.
applause I need them.
applause And Congresswoman Elizabeth Furse  what can I say?
applause And that's what the United States of America has done and we will do by waging a focused  relentless effort to hunt down any terrorist that would harm the United States of America and our citizens.
applause If we stand still  freedom loses.
applause Health insurance reform right now.
applause Of course  we are in the Four Corners area  the only place in the country where you can stand in four states at one time.
applause So it's appropriate that we have here this sub-compact model --   -- that is an inexhaustible source of energy.
applause Real disposable personal income is growing strongly  meaning that American workers have more money to spend  to save and invest.
applause But we have something more to offer to the world than just that.
applause This bill assesses how growth and climate change will affect our access to water resources  especially in the West and Southwest  and it includes solutions to complex and long-simmering water disputes.
applause We are delighted to be back in Ohio and glad to be back in Cleveland.
applause Thank you.
applause The willingness of good folks who have done pretty well in life to come together and say  how can I help a neighbor find a job; what can I do to help a neighbor develop a skill.
applause That's why we're launching Promise Neighborhoods to build on Geoffrey Canada's success in Harlem with a comprehensive approach to ending poverty by giving people the tools they need to pull themselves up.
applause He is a most worthy successor to Michael Ancram to whom the Party in Scotland owes so much
applause And the approach on this aspect is very simple.
applause These are tough times  and yet there's no doubt in my mind that you want to secure this homeland just as much as I do.
applause We're honored to be here with the First Lady of Wisconsin and  of course  I'm honored to be traveling with the First Lady of the United States.
applause Americans with disabilities are an enormous  largely untapped reservoir of that potential.
applause So I'm trying to think about what I should do when I leave office  and I think I'll do birthday parties.
applause I want Mr. Nixon to come home for a while.
applause The President is working with many countries in a global effort to end the trade and transfer of these deadly technologies.
applause And then the third instance  the instance of Cuba - here again shooting from the hip  but not in the Texas fashion  because he missed the mark completely   shooting from the hip and  rather than following the President  who said we'll handle this fellow  Castro  within our treaties by quarantining him economically and politically  he said: No; no.
applause There have been four or five such periods in our country's history.
applause Now  there are a couple of ideas on the table  and let me mention two of those  and then I'll stop and we'll have an opportunity to respond to questions or comments from all of you.
applause Their families are doing their part; it's time we did our part.
applause Goli will be a valuable leader in winning the war on terror  and in making the people of Oregon more secure.
applause And it reminded us so much of all the places we visited on our bus tour in 1992  when we all got on the bus together and rode across America.

applause But we all know that you have too  and soon you'll be joined in congratulating them.
applause There are a lot of people working hard on our citizens' behalf to protect this homeland.
applause I know we've got some of the many veterans who live in this area with us today.
applause Officers of the Chemical Workers  ladies and gentlemen  I am delighted to be here today  and I am delighted to be in the company of my colleague in the Congress of the United States  my colleague on the Labor Committee  your next speaker Congressman James Roosevelt   and with the distinguished Governor of the State of New Jersey  Robert Meyner.
applause God bless.
applause We believe he thinks Vince Lombardi is a foreign leader.
applause I am eternally grateful for the good sense  good humour and loyalty of Willie Whitelaw.
applause We welcome all people; we welcome anybody.
applause Next  we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow.
applause I don't run on that program at all.
applause My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.
applause In Iraq  we took another essential step in the war on terror.
applause And therefore  we must make sure that our United States military must have everything it needs to meet the objective.
applause This hotel  since you're here for that  I should tell you  this hotel plays a huge role in my life.
applause Budget deficits matter  and we have no right to borrow from our children to pay for tax rebates today.
applause That's what the United States of America is about.
applause I want to recognize all the members of Congress who are with us  as well as the top scientists from my administration  including my science advisor John Holdren  who is here.
applause It's getting a little quiet on the ranch --   -- so I decided to pay a visit to the "devildogs."
applause They ask the American people to stand with our troops.
applause In fact  I visited the plant before it had produced its very first truck.
applause She's worked hard to spread the important message of the dangers of alcohol abuse among young people.
applause But if we look upon it  if we look upon ourselves as human beings  I doubt that anyone will deny that extremism in defense of liberty  the liberty of any human being  is no vice.
applause And then the attacks happened on our country.
applause Social Security  which I think I can correctly helped save  along with Sen. Moynihan in 1983  has lifted generations of elderly out of poverty.
applause And we get a tap on our shoulder  and we turn around and it's the Republicans.
applause And when it comes to big spending  the National Taxpayers Union has given him their "Big Spenders" award.
applause When President Bush and I stood on the inaugural platform on the west front of the Capitol and took the oath of office  January of 2001  our economy was sliding toward recession.
applause Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases  because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.
applause And it's all part of a pattern.
applause And what's in their interest is to have Ernie Fletcher as the Governor of the state of Kentucky.
applause You've also got to focus  as we talked about  on tax policy.
applause It's the darnedest accounting system I've ever seen.
applause First of all  you already saw him  Governor Ted Strickland in the house.
applause And  in fact  tomorrow is the eighty-fourth anniversary of women's suffrage.
applause That's in my balanced budget plan  too  so they can keep their families and take care of them.
applause They are making history that will light up the horizon of coming generations  for their mission is the emancipation of the human race.
applause But probably the best reform to make sure that happens is to eliminate the death tax so family farmers aren't forced to sell their farms before they want to.
applause What veterans have given our country is beyond our power to fully repay  yet  today we recognize our debt to their honor.
applause I also want to say a special word of thanks out of my own history to the Davison High School Band for playing for us.
applause I think George Bush is the right man for that job.
applause But I tell you  my fellow Americans  now is the time to act and to go forward and to finish the work that was done in the beginning six years ago.
applause It seems unlikely  given the life I've had.
applause And I'll never get even  I'll never get caught up.
applause And in Afghanistan  women and girls can now be educated.
applause But I can take no satisfaction in them.
applause Because the danger is that you heat up the international atmosphere by a war of words  heat it up to the point that a nuclear catastrophe can destroy civilization as we know it.
applause But ethnic cleansing  and killing people wholesale because of their race or religion  is wrong.
applause There are folks in this country who actually think the government has money.
applause I visited Ohio a few weeks ago to meet with a woman entrepreneur  and she summed up our success this way.
applause If they read this  they will know it will work and they'll know about it and they'll understand how to do it.
applause So if somebody asks you tomorrow why were you here  can you give them the economic answer?
applause I ask your help in this campaign.
applause Her district is the first one where I met young men who had been in gangs  who were walking the streets with her to save the lives of other young people.
applause It took almost a decade after the Velvet Revolution for democracy to fully take root in this country.
applause He should say the same thing in La Crosse as he does in New Jersey.
applause So the bottom line is this: The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable.
applause And it took a Conservative Government to give the nurses the independent Pay Review Body for which they were asking.
applause Thank you  sir.
applause We have not met the promise of Brown when a fourth-grade Hispanic child is only one-third as likely to read at the same level as a fourth-grade white child; when only 50 percent of African-Americans are finishing high school and only 18 percent are graduating from college.
applause Last month we found out -- or just two weeks ago we found out that we had the biggest decline in income inequality among working people in 27 years  since this administration came in; the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years; the biggest drop in poverty in female-headed households in 30 years; the lowest recorded poverty levels ever for senior citizens and African Americans; the largest number of new businesses owned by minorities and women in the history of the country; the largest number of new small businesses owned by anybody in the history of the country.
applause I know there have been difficulties these last few years.
applause I'd like to thank some others who came with me -- Congressman Dale Kildee  who's over here on my left.
applause Unemployment is going down  and we find that more Americans are employed today  earning more  spending more  investing more than at any time in history.
applause It is stuck in the Senate.
applause Let me also say something about the next senator from the state of Florida -- Kendrick Meek.
applause Of course  English is the language of the United States.
applause And indeed we are a nation whose ideals are founded on the Bible.
applause When the President and I took the oath of office  on January 1  2001  our economy was sliding into recession.
applause Even when both parents worked outside of the home  most families in my neighborhood sat down at the table together as a family for a meal.
applause And let the rise in inflation which unfortunately occurred last month—deeply worrying to pensioners  householders and businesses as it is—let that small rise be an abiding lesson to those who would pursue a general policy of reflation and throw restraint to the winds.
applause Let's give our kids everything they need and everything they deserve to be the best that they can be.
applause I appreciate very much that warm welcome.
applause And I know that's created a lot of howling in Washington  but I think you can help remind people over whom you've got some influence that the whole notion of dropping the top rate is to stimulate growth in the small business sector of America.
applause Thank you very much.
applause We will then settle the remaining fundamental issues  especially those of Jerusalem  the refugees and the settlements.
applause Our whole country is proud of them  and they're proving every day that when we send them to defend this nation and our interests  we are sending the very best of the United States of America.
applause They want the United States of America and other freedom-loving nations to retreat from the world.
applause It strains state and local budgets.
applause And very soon  both houses will have to vote on a piece of legislation that is binding  a bill to provide emergency funding for the troops.
applause He'd like to do it in the fairly traditional way  when the U.S. is attacked.
applause But obviously part of what makes Magic special wasn't just how he played on the court  but also just the infectious enthusiasm about life and what he's now doing with businesses and minority communities.
applause In America  his commitment to the ideal of democracy continues to inspire us all  and I can tell you that his inspiration is still felt in his native Poland where the people will never forget what he did and what he stood for.
applause We've got to get rid of all these junk lawsuits that are threatening small businesses  the job creators.
applause We're going to go forward.
applause Speaking of running  I want to congratulate Ricky Dobbs for setting the NCAA rushing record for touchdowns by a quarterback this season with 27.
applause There's a lot of significance to whether you believe we should build a bridge to the future we can all walk across  or just show people the Valley and say  I hope you can find some way to get over it; whether you believe that we're out there on our own because the government is intrinsically our enemy or whether you think that the government is just another part of this great partnership we call America  and Hillary was right  it does take a village to raise a child and build a community and build a future.
applause 1 and I pledge this to you today: America must continue to be the strongest military nation in the world.
applause And we have hope because the people of Haiti are not alone.
applause But it does not provide similar protection for the rights of victims  and that must change.
applause It's a fair plan.
applause Thanks to your efforts  there are drugs and other treatments that can dramatically reduce hospital stays which  in turn  improves quality of care and quality of life.
applause Our amazing Secretary of Education Arne Duncan knows.
applause And to help families and small businesses  we'll lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code.
applause And all of you  I can't tell you how much I appreciate you being here.
applause Every terrorist is at war with civilization  and every group or nation that aids them is equally responsible for the murders that the terrorists commit.
applause So thank you very much.
applause And for everyone who goes on to more college  to four years of college or graduate school  I believe there ought to be a $10 000 tax deduction for the cost of college tuition for every year anybody is in education.
applause And I'm proud of the work that the Department of Justice is doing to enforce Olmstead across the country.
applause Well everybody in politics has baggage.
applause Today that founding concept is under attack from those who see European unity as a vehicle for spreading Socialism.
applause These two projects "Operation Consume" and "Operation Safeguard" will make excessive controls and idle surpluses unhappy memories and farm families can expect to share fully in the promise and opportunity of a free America.
applause I believe we've achieved a great deal in these two-and-a-half years  but there's much left to do in Washington and around the world.
applause And they said  "Well  they have what's called a scholarship.
applause And so in my budget  we ask Congress to increase the pay for the men and women who wear the uniform  to make sure they're better paid and better housed.
applause Not as sorry as you  probably.
applause I welcome and congratulate the award winners  my friends Julius Chambers and Alvin Brown and Tom Joyner.
applause You've got the money in your pocket and you're a young couple  you can say  ‘Right  that's marvellous.
applause I cannot tell you how proud I am of the will of the American people and the strength of the United States military.
applause All of you have been working on these issues for so long.
applause We're all getting older  none of us are going to be here forever.
applause So I give you this promise.
applause I want to thank Joy's husband  Don Padgett  who is here today.
applause Then terrorists struck on 9/11 and shook our economy once again.
applause Again  Nellie  thank you for letting me come to speak to you.
applause He says that we didn't put sufficient emphasis on destroying weapons in Iraq  a charge he cynically made not knowing if it was true  and a charge that simply isn't borne out by the facts.
applause And I think it made a difference when we lowered the deficit and increased our investment in our future  and got this economy going again.
applause I never had to be told that play was important -- it just came natural to me.
applause It's an initiative that recognizes there are still people who hurt in America.
applause Now.
applause We'd do well to remember that today.
applause I came to the office of the President to solve problems instead of passing them on to future Presidents and future generations.
applause Because the hope of freedom in Eastern Europe  the hope of stalemating the Communist advance and turning it  depends not upon goodwill missions  of which we have had so many in recent years.
applause I wish we'd talk to them  because I think it's common sense for the country  too.
applause When we passed those tax relief measures  some people back in Washington had their doubts.
applause And  therefore  we must open the doors of college education to every single citizen of this country who is willing to work for it.
applause Ten million women own their own business in America  and this sisterhood just keeps growing.
applause This is the third year that the Connecticut Ladies have been here since I've been the President.
applause Give them a big round of applause.
applause It's why I think it should be expanded.
applause That is our goal in Iraq.
applause It's good to be with you.
applause There are still millions of men and women who want to end their dependence on government and become independent through hard work.
applause I am honored to have you by my side.
applause I believe he'll be a great President.
applause We grew up together  went to high school together.
applause But if you just give people things and they never act like responsible citizens  the whole country comes apart at the seams.
applause They understand that in order to have a free democracy  you must have minority rights.
applause There are also proposals to provide loan forgiveness for primary care physicians who choose to practice in rural and underserved areas.
applause You know  maybe the Vice President should stay up all night more often.
applause We must use technologies to be able to use the resources at hand.
applause Yesterday  an historic gathering occurred in the city of An Nasiriyah  where Iraqis met openly and freely to discuss the future of the country.
applause And our failure to get it done -- year after year  and decade after decade -- has placed a burden on families and on businesses and on taxpayers that we can no longer sustain.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause And while we're on alert at home and doing everything we can to protect innocent life in America  the surest way to defend America  the surest way to make sure our children grow up in a peaceful and free society  is to be relentless in our pursuit of those who would harm America  those who hate freedom  and bring them to justice.
applause Almost two decades ago  your Governor  Jim Hunt  began an education reform program that included higher standards in these schools.
applause I don't give any stakes to Mr. Nixon in this campaign.
applause If Mr. Nixon and Mr. Nixon would debate  we would really have an interesting discussion.
applause I think we ought to bring jobs to all the people and places that have been left behind.
applause No to middle-class tax cuts.
applause During the lifetime of the coming parliament  oil production is expected to reach its peak  and thereafter lose its power to conceal our predicament.
applause Almost a million families in this state got an income tax cut because they're working hard for modest wages.
applause Some of the finest governors in the country are here -- let me take them in order of good looks -- sorry  Arnold.
applause But in the meantime  I'm focused on the people's business in Washington  D.C.
applause In this new era of warfare  we can target a regime  not a nation.
applause I believe today that as we elect the next President and Vice President of the United States that it is essential that all of us think not of the party first but of the country first  and I submit our case to you on the basis what is best for America because that is what we need.
applause First of all  I'm very proud of our Mayor  who was  in his previous life  a member of my administration.
applause Second  for the reasons I said earlier  when none of you wanted to contract away your projected income for the next 10 years  he is the most likely  by far  to keep our prosperity going and to spread it to people left behind.
applause More than a few consumers counted on their earnings in the stock market to help them carry their obligations.
applause Rachel  Dayo both did just an outstanding job in laying out the organizations that are working with us today  the schools.
applause Yes!
applause Here in Ohio  your unemployment rate is 5.8 percent -- down from 6.3 percent last July  and moving in the right direction.
applause Everyone has to take that into account and we are deeply attached to this.
applause And I would say to you  all of you  my fellow public servants  this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians.
applause Mr. Nixon is.
applause Our obligation is to secure the borders.
applause Thirdly  I want to tell you that I  at this time two years from now  intend to be President of the United States.
applause We've created health savings accounts so families can save  tax-free  for their own health care needs.
applause Thank you so much.
applause Tuesday  there is no Caesar.
applause Let me tell you something.
applause And I believe we have now come to the point where  in their assault on marriage  and in their assault on innocent life  and in their insufferable assault on the liberty and constitutional self-government that ought to be the birthright of every American  the judiciary has put us all in the position where we are called upon to tolerate their abuse  tolerate their evil  tolerate their wrong  and it is insufferable!
applause Keep going where we're going.
applause It is the promise of America.
applause Lastly  let me say on education  I simply don't believe that we should be cutting education to reduce the deficit or pay for tax cuts.
applause In these circumstances it's worth reminding ourselves that  like it or not  the enemy we face in the war on terror has made Iraq the primary front in that war.
applause You better stick with us.
applause So we won't let the tax system put you into poverty even if you just make a little bit of money; we will use the tax system to lift you out of poverty.
applause So we hope to improve on this bill in the Senate and go even further on behalf of students.
applause Many millions more are spent by researchers in the private sector.
applause And this is the great tragedy.
applause He only had one term to serve  so he was willing to do something crazy like endorse me that quick.
applause Governor Schwarzenegger has responsibility to set good policy in Sacramento.
applause They tried to convince every hunter in my state that they were going to lose their guns if we banned assault weapons and passed the Brady Bill.

applause He's given more than two decades of outstanding service to the people of Louisiana in the United States Congress.
applause This campaign is coming to an end.
applause Thank you.
applause The balanced budget I sign into law today will continue our successful economic strategy.
applause We've all seen the recent tape of Osama bin Laden.
applause The government must respect private property.
applause But they didn't achieve that until they understood that the key to that success  the key to turning away from all of those things that undermine and destroy  is not learning to love yourself and learning to forgive yourself  it's learning to love God and understand that He forgives you  if He will.
applause That's not why you put in all those hours in the Anatomy Suite or the O.R.
applause And  of course  we've got to acknowledge the big man here --   -- and he is big.
applause That's all I want to say.
applause One by one  we are eliminating power centers of a regime that harbors al Qaeda terrorists.
applause And this plan covers these mammograms at no additional cost to patients for all women over 50  and provides mammograms where important in the judgment of the physician and the woman in every case where there is a health care plan.
applause I want to thank Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta for joining us.
applause We're making progress here at home.

applause We doubled the child tax credit  reduced the marriage penalty  cut taxes on small business and began phasing out the death tax.
applause We have not forgotten the victims of September the 11th -- the last phone calls  the cold murder of children  the searches in the rubble.
applause May God bless you and may God bless our wonderful country.
applause I assure you that the new Democratic Congress  and I hope a new Democratic administration  will press for action to implement their work.
applause So we very much appreciate that.
applause Because of our actions in 2001 and again in 2003  a married couple with two children and household income of $40 000 will see their federal income tax bill fall this year from $1 978 to only $45.
applause That's a job for everyone.
applause Going forward  as the Iraqi security forces grow in strength and the political process continues to advance  we'll be able to reduce troop levels without losing our capacity to defeat the terrorists.
applause I'll also present the exceptional service award to the woman who took part in that daring rescue  Tracy McVay.
applause First  Representative Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts  who has worked to make the Community Reinvestment Act a reality for all Americans in all communities.

applause They were unable to attend due to a prior lack of commitment.
applause Well  six years later  we've gone from a $290 billion deficit to  in 1999  a $99 billion surplus -- $142 billion next year -- and we have cut the government to its smallest size since Kennedy was President.
applause But with the nation losing nearly 800 000 jobs the month that I was sworn into office  my most urgent task was to stop a financial meltdown and prevent this recession from becoming a second depression.
applause I'm honored to be in the Rocky Mountain state.
applause Great job.
applause And so  if our freedom and our lack of self-control produces results that correspond to that nightmare  then we will surrender control.

applause And I say that for a number of reasons  but I say that first  because when you compare the farm programs that I announced in two speeches  one at Guthrie's center  the other yesterday in Sioux Falls  with the farm program that our opponents announced at Sioux Falls  believe me the American farmers aren't going to be fooled.
applause Thank you so much.
applause Most of all  thank you all.

applause The United States will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country.
applause Let me say to all of you  first of all  a profound thanks.

applause I do want to say again  though  we have to try look deeper at the cause of the violence.
applause I'm proud we've got folks from the statehouse here -- Secretary of State Jan Brewer is with us.

applause Lately he's been saying he's proud that he and John Edwards voted no  and he explains that his decision was "complicated."
applause We will make it easier to identify health care disparities and work to close them.
applause And none of that would have happened if we hadn't reinvented the relationship between the President and the Vice President.
applause Based on the notion that when it comes to health care research and delivery  women can no longer be treated as second-class citizens.
applause Well  to all of you  Nancy and I are delighted that you have been here.
applause I want to thank the members of the House and the Senate who are here.
applause Yesterday in Arizona he made a speech to a group that Senator Goldwater had gathered together  saying he is all for the Republican Party and all of its candidates  and then he spoke about an hour later and said "Well  the party does not make much difference; it is the man."
applause Our nation must recognize that if we can change a heart  we're more than likely to change someone's habits  and addiction on drugs and alcohol.
applause And has been a great comforter for a lot of Americans during some of our difficult times.
applause He says they're the three most beautifully designed things our culture has produced  and the three greatest tributes to American improvisation.

applause Confident people tear them down.
applause And we've got to give them some incentives to stay so that the kids who need the most help are getting some of the best teachers.
applause Thank you for being here tonight.
applause So now  it's my great pleasure to introduce our Vice President  Al Gore.
applause I'm just saying.
applause But that's not a reason not to make them.
applause Their true ambition is to dominate and control and remake whole societies in their own cruel image.
applause And we went in  took down Saddam Hussein's regime.
applause I came to seize opportunities instead of letting them slip away.
applause That's what we've been trying to stop.
applause It's a big issue in the New York Senate race  it's a big issue in the national presidential race.

applause I propose to let you take a credit -- just take it off your taxes  dollar for dollar  for the cost of tuition at the typical community college in America.
applause We also know that as significant as these reforms are  there's going to be one more ingredient to really make a difference: parents are going to have to get more involved in their children's education.
applause I want people to know we came here to a place that has done important things -- to give kids who need it extra help  to have high standards  to do things that will create a vision that people will want to act on.
applause And that's why I appreciate what the Prime Minister is trying to do  in trying to bring America and the rest of the world to a common position.
applause We're aggressively striking the terrorists in Iraq  defeating them there so we will not have to face them in our own country.
applause We will always seek international support for international efforts  but as President Bush has made very clear  there is a difference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few.
applause This nation has made a decision: We will engage the enemy -- facing him with our military force in Afghanistan and Iraq today  so we do not have to face him with armies of firefighters  police  and medical personnel on the streets of our own cities.
applause Today a coalition of telecommunications leaders is determined to join forces with you and with our police.
applause Now is the time to mount an offensive for freedom  to advance the cause of freedom  and not to return to a policy of retreat and defeat.
applause All of you know that this is a challenging time to be in the military.
applause We look forward to working with her for many years to come.
applause Otherwise it won't be a faith-based program.

applause I know the powerful interests are going to fight against us with everything they've got.
applause David.
applause I like the fact that he's an engineer.

applause We are not providing aid for our education.
applause All of us believe that it is time that the United States started moving again.
applause We've got great backing from Republicans and independents  and we're proud to say that we've also got a lot of support from many Democrats like Georgia's Senator Zell Miller.

applause We need to explore for new sources of energy in environmentally friendly ways.
applause No  we're bound together in this war on terror.

applause So I want to thank you all for coming.
applause You watch -- I tell you  I love watching these Republicans now  butter wouldn't melt in their mouth.
applause Junk lawsuits make it hard to have a state that creates jobs.
applause I came here because I knew before I got here -- although I had never quite experienced the full force of it until you were shouting and screaming and having such a good time -- I knew that this was about more than making bikes for profit; more than selling attractive leather jackets.
applause Finally  let me say to our friends in the other party  I sat out there in the heartland of America as the governor for years and years and years  and I heard them talk about how terrible the federal government was  and how big and bloated it was.
applause We owe so much to our fighting men and women  and I want to thank them and all the veterans here today for what they have done for all of us.
applause That's all right.
applause We live with the consequences of our lack of investment in children 20 years after the investments don't get made.
applause It's good public policy for America.
applause But ultimately  we must judge people by their values and their contribution.
applause And just last week  the House of Representatives passed a bill that will go a long way to reform the student loan system so that college is more affordable for more people.
applause The terrorists have seen speeding tank convoys and roaring jets and special forces arriving in midnight raids.
applause This is a --   -- this is an active bridge.
applause Is that what you called me?
applause That's how we'll lead the global economy in this century  just like we did in the last century.

applause That is the most important thing we can do -- to lift the income of the American people.
applause It's time for a new attitude when it comes to the education of our children  particularly starting in Washington  D.C.

applause In just the last two years  Nancy has brought more than $24 million in federal funding to defense projects in Connecticut -- helping protect our nation  and employing hundreds of people in your state.
applause And I want everybody to understand: That's at least two years earlier than previously planned -- and that's conservative  given that the previous program was behind schedule and over budget.
applause I am grateful that for the last eight years I had a Vice President who spoke out strongly for these values and these policies  and helped us to do what we have done to be good stewards of the land.
applause That's the kind of spirit it's going to take to turn this country around and move the country forward.
applause In the past  every time there was an initiative to make the workplace more family-friendly  to do more child care  to pass family leave legislation and things like that  the other said  well  we would like to do that  that seems like a very nice thing  but it would be too burdensome to the business economy  and so we can't.
applause This great land  this compassionate nation is leading the world in this incredibly important work of human rescue.
applause I've never been able to do that.

applause I appreciate that very warm welcome.
applause And today  we spend $900 million on breast cancer research  which is 30 times more than what we spent in 1982.
applause Well one of the things I've learned from my experience in the government is that the last thing we should ever do with the foreign policy of the United States is leave it in the hands of the State Department.
applause And they said -- and we lost the House of Representatives  in part  because I signed that and the assault weapons ban  because they scared all the gun owners in the country into believing we were going to take their guns away and they wouldn't be able to go hunting.
applause It is great to be here at OPOWER.
applause And we will continue to do so.
applause I say "honor " because that base houses some of the finest men and women our country have ever known.

applause Clearly  Thomas Jefferson never had cable news to contend with --   -- but his central point remains: A government without newspapers  a government without a tough and vibrant media of all sorts  is not an option for the United States of America.
applause If it floods and prints more money into the economy than is backed by goods and services produced  that extra money will find its way into rising prices.
applause We are counting on you to be the very best people that you can be.
applause And that is an idealism  a flaming idealism; an idealism equal to that that our founders had during the course of the American Revolution which caught the imagination of the world 185 years ago; an idealism that will recognize that freedom  and not communism  is the way to the future; an idealism which will be confident in America's strength  that will never buy the false doctrine that America is second rate in anything  and we are not in the world today.

applause And we appreciate your families and employers who support you in your vital work.
applause We believe our nation is "one nation under God " and that Americans ought to be able to say so when we pledge allegiance to the flag.

applause My Lord   Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.
applause When they see a medical emergency  a cell phone can connect them to the ambulance service immediately.
applause You've given Germany a fine Chancellor in Angela Merkel  who I'm proud to call friend.
applause We can do this by sending ninety percent of all federal education dollars back to community classrooms rather than wasting it on Washington bureaucrats.
applause The short answer is that we pass a law requiring every employer to provide access to quality coverage  with employer tax credits covering most of the cost.
applause If leaders of the other party have innovative ideas  let's hear them.
applause They said the sky would fall; they said the economy would come to an end.
applause Great to be outside  isn't it?
applause Ladies and gentlemen  it's my very  very great pleasure to introduce to you one of the men that has made a difference over these past few years in Northern Ireland: the Deputy First Minister  a good friend  a good colleague and a good man  Seamus Mallon.
applause And to show our debt to the families of all police officers who lose their lives on duty  Congress has also passed the Hometown Heroes Survivor Benefit Act  a measure that was proudly signed into law last year by President Bush.
applause I ask them to come to Ohio and meet the 25 men and women who will soon be protecting the streets of Columbus because we passed this plan.

applause I want to talk about some of the challenges that face America.
applause Mortgage rates  and interest rates  and inflation are all low.
applause After I was nominated at the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles  the first thing I did was to ask him if he would take over the leadership of the Democratic Party because I wanted him at my side representing the progressive  clean  and responsible government of the North-western United States.
applause I won't be offended.
applause Today the American Ambassador is not.
applause I don't believe we should give government or the insurance companies more control over health care in America.
applause What have they done since then?
applause Dean was the antiwar candidate and Dean was surging ahead in the polls  so John Kerry  in order to advance himself in the Democratic primaries  turned his back on the troops.
applause This is a country founded 220 years ago by people who said  we believe all people are created equal.
applause With Billy's support  we'll help families and small businesses by reforming and simplifying the federal tax code.
applause President Bush will always make sure that America's troops have the resources and the support they need to complete their missions.
applause I don't agree with that.
applause There is a virtually unlimited potential abroad and at home for this  and I keep hoping if we just keep pushing and keep pushing and keep pushing we will reach a critical mass of investment which will explode it and let the whole world know that this works.
applause Because of the increased expensing allowance  they were able to invest in new trucks and new computers so they were prepared to do more business when the economy recovered.
applause Victims of the worst system of economic oppression.
applause What the Democrats are doing is outrageous  and that's why we need to send George Voinovich back to the United States Senate.
applause Our transportation wasn't quite as fancy back then -- an Oldsmobile Cutlass  and George was behind the wheel.
applause One candidate will accede and the other will accept.
applause Together  working with like-minded Democrats and Republicans  we can make this America's cause.
applause Thank you.
applause Now  everything that should be up is up  thanks to Ed Rendell  and he's going to keep our party up  as well.
applause I truly believe the history of this century forces me to believe that to do nothing in Central America is to give the first Communist stronghold on the North American continent a green light to spread its poison throughout this free and increasingly democratic hemisphere.
applause And let me pledge to you  we will never let you down.
applause There will be no summit meeting or negotiations with terrorists.
applause Delay will mean the death of reform one more time if it happens.
applause Too many people who wanted to work could not find a job.
applause Bill after World War II built the greatest middle class in the history of the world because the government tried to help people make the most of their own lives.
applause We won't rest until everyone who wants a job can find a job.
applause We're going to call in citizens and get input.
applause We hope they will lead more and more Americans not only to seize the opportunity of a college education  and to exert a stronger sense of responsibility  but also to seek to serve their communities through a program of national service.
applause I'm not for that.
applause It's hard to think of any category of information that could be more important to the safety of the United States.
applause I found out there's only one -- a rising junior from Ranchester  Wyoming.
applause He's done a fantastic job for the country  and I appreciate your service  Tom.
applause Senator Kerry has earned a special distinction in Congress  though.

applause This State nourished the great Republic.
applause I want to establish a G.I.
applause Well  I appreciate all of you being here today  and I appreciate that warm welcome  Randy.
applause But I still think we ought to ban those bullets that are built only for one purpose  to pierce the bullet-proof vests that our police officers wear.
applause They always said  look  in America  we always look to the future.
applause Tax relief is critical to our small businesses.
applause Now  I served in the House of Representatives for 10 years from Wyoming.
applause Bless you for coming tonight.
applause Thanks for having me.
applause I mean  there are no problems here.
applause Now  the federal government pays up to 50 percent of the cost of vests that state and local officers buy -- or agencies buy for their officers.
applause We all know that learning doesn't end at graduation.
applause And we also want to give more funds to school districts around the country so they can be open longer hours.
applause Those three points.
applause None of this was discussed.
applause Okay  ladies  raise your hand.
applause It's taken us about a year and 15 months to get a lot of these things done.
applause There are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people's lives.
applause Veterans have been promised good health care when they are sick and disabled; they must be treated with fairness and respect.
applause The Fire Department of Arlington  Virginia was first on the scene after the attack on the Pentagon.
applause That's not all.
applause And if safety does not improve  students must get the option of attending another public school.
applause We're not only going to be listening to what happens to the electoral votes at the top of the ticket  we're going to be listening to what happens to those six Congressmen from Connecticut.
applause Finally  it would crack down on illegal gun trafficking  doubling the number of cities now working with the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearms to trace every gun seized by the police.
applause I want to thank the men and women who build the machinery here.
applause And what does that mean?
applause And that problem is quite evident in the second sentence.
applause These accounts enable people to buy a low-premium  high-deductible insurance plan and use tax-free savings to pay for routine health expenses like eyeglasses or prescriptions.
applause When you cast your vote next Tuesday  you're doing more than choosing a candidate for the House or Senate.
applause It is not necessary to balance the budget  and it undermines the very purpose of doing it.
applause You know  I like to tell people that Lynne and I got together because of a great Republican electoral victory in 1952  when Dwight Eisenhower ran for President.
applause Throughout Coastal Georgia you find remarkable community spirit for the military  and I know it means everything to our people in uniform and to their loved ones.
applause And we grew up together  went to high school together  and later this month  we'll mark our 40th wedding anniversary.
applause The reason NAFTA was important  the reason GATT's important  the reason our outreach in Asia is important  the reason this Summit of the Americas is phenomenally important and why I want it to be in this building today with the fine Secretary General we're very proud to see in this leadership position  is because America cannot and will not succeed  and we will never restore stability to the lives of the working people of our country until we have more folks buying what we sell; until the work of our people is rewarded more.
applause I was particularly glad to see Niki Tsongas.
applause I met her when I came in.
applause We have a plan to help high school students who fall behind in reading and math.
applause Our party can reasonably claim to be the leading democratic party in the world –
applause For the sake of America's entrepreneurs  families  and communities  we need to make the Bush tax cuts permanent -- and we can do that with a new Republican Congress.
applause With the terrorists  there can be no negotiations  or appeals to reason or conscience.
applause But the record is testimony not to good luck  but to urgent  competent action by a lot of very skilled men and women -- and to a series of tough decisions by a President who never forgets that his first job is to protect the people of this country.
applause So I invite anybody who thinks we shouldn't have taken those actions that we took last year  or made those investments  to come to Youngstown and explain to us why that plant shouldn't be built.
applause All of us want peace.
applause The tremendous revolution in agriculture  which has provided a great increase in the production of food and a sharp decrease in farm income - all these will come to rest upon the desk of the next President of the United States.
applause But I often tell people that Lynne and I got married because Dwight Eisenhower got elected President of the United States  and that in those years in the early '50s  I lived in Lincoln with my folks.
applause Because we have taken the fight to the enemy  we've been able to uncover critical information about terrorists' plots  including preparations that have been made to attack the United States.
applause He also said  "This is a fight we have to win to ensure the survival of freedom."
applause The days of excuse-making are over when it comes to education.
applause But even aside from the debate  the records of the parties are written on the statute books of the United States  on the bills that become law  on the bills that the Republicans prevented from becoming law.
applause The moral concern of humanity extends to those unborn children who are harmed or killed in crimes against their mothers.

applause We've had three event co-chairmen  the Guzzettas  the Gaineses  and Elizabeth Fago.
applause I don't care whether you're driving a hybrid or an SUV -- if you're headed for a cliff  you've got to change direction.
applause I have a responsibility as President to make sure the judicial system runs well.
applause And that is a very positive thing.
applause I run against a man who wanted to send American troops into Indochina in 1954 and yet could say last year at the time of difficulty in Tibet that he was unconcerned about the Communist advance in that area.
applause It's a broken record to say that the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is at the heart of so much  but it's a broken record because it's broken so many lives.
applause Some they're aware of -- the prospect of war  an economy in steep decline  a nagging concern that bluster and swagger have taken the place of diplomacy and reason.
applause We must welcome faith in the essential delivery of need for people who hurt.
applause You may have seen the picture in the newspaper.
applause Believe me  it beats packing up all my old books.
applause Where is this going?
applause And all Americans can be certain of this: We are going to maintain our optimistic  pro-growth  pro-entrepreneur  pro-jobs strategy in Washington  D.C. With the right policies  and with the incredible energy and talent of American workers all across this country  we'll keep a good thing going  and see even better days in the greatest nation on Earth.
applause If we are to be told that a Conservative Government could not govern because certain extreme leaders would not let it  then General Elections are a mockery we've arrived atthe one party state  and parliamentary democracy in this country will have perished.
applause I'm glad to be here with Senator Glenn and Congressman Fingerhut  Congressman Stokes  Congressman Sawyer  Congressman Hoke  former Congresswoman Mary Rose Oaker is here and as an Arab-American is going to the Middle East with the American delegation.
applause We share the relief of his family  his friends and his loved ones that he is now safe and sound.
applause It is clear that the future of freedom and peace depend upon the actions of America.
applause Our belief in liberty and opportunity and the non-negotiable demands of human dignity will not change.
applause Together  we can build a world where people are protected  prosperity is enlarged  and our power truly serves progress.
applause But  you know  the principle  that univ college and university students should be able to vote either in the place of their residence or in the town where they attend school was established by the Supreme Court more than 30 years ago  and I was disappointed to see it under assault in this election and gratified that students  like those of you here  were willing to fight to make sure that your voices were heard and your votes were counted  and I thank you for that.
applause It is the fundamental fact of our time.
applause We passed trade promotion authority to open up new markets for Florida's ranchers and farmers and entrepreneurs and manufacturers.
applause People who saw their own houses flattened rose to the aid of neighbors.
applause Now  if you want these things  and you want to achieve these big goals  you've got to make the right decision.
applause In the last two years  a lot of the important things we did were opposed by somewhere between a majority and 100 percent of the members of the other party.
applause But the excitement and the hope and the energy -- that came out of your belief that that gap between what is and what's possible  that gap can be closed if everybody pulls together  if everybody's serious  if everybody is committed.
applause We learned his definition when I was a cadet at West Point.
applause Thank you all for coming.
applause They have already dedicated a huge amount of money to their own charitable activities  way over a billion dollars  and I thank them for that as well.
applause We welcome this charge of history and we are keeping it.
applause Therefore  I come to this shopping center  which is not the largest in the world  but it is large enough  to ask your support.
applause You all sit down.
applause On any bus  and any lunch counter and any voting booth; in any school  in the Armed Forces  in the highest echelons of government and business -- you belong everywhere.
applause We keep an eye out for those who try to move deadly weapons across these waters.
applause If you want to be involved  there's all kinds of ways.
applause When you've got blinders on  like our president  you just don't see those who are left by the side of the road.
applause Our high noon is yet to come.
applause As a matter of fact  people just kind of looked at folks that were different and darker and they said  "You are not human!
applause I believe that we have in Indiana a tough fight  but my judgment is that Indiana  which has not supported the national ticket of the Democratic Party since 1936  has had enough.
applause I mention these gentlemen because first  they're fine leaders.
applause That's how Medicare was born.
applause And let me say  not a single sportsman or hunter in Colorado -- notwithstanding what they were told in 1994 -- has lost their hunting or sporting weapon -- not a single  solitary one  not one.
applause How can you correct problems if you do not diagnose the problem in the first place?
applause That's called tough defense  hard-nosed defense.
applause But we submitted a budget that sets priorities.
applause It is irresponsible to vote against vital support for the U.S. military.
applause And then we must do whatever is necessary and be willing to pay the cost in dollars  which are necessary  to see that America's military strength will deter aggression and keep the peace in this area; this we must do.
applause Out of the House came a $1.6-trillion plan  and now the Senate  somewhat reluctant  but nevertheless  they passed a $1.2-trillion plan.
applause So thank you very much everybody.
applause Thank you.
applause I have an opponent.
applause When President Bush and I stood on the inaugural platform on the west front of the Capitol and took the oath of office  our economy was sliding into recession.
applause Thank you.
applause Thank you.
applause And the question is: Do we build on and go forward from an administration in which we have had the greatest progress and prosperity  without war  that this Nation has ever had; or do we go back to the policies which we left which were a mess 7 years ago  and no better today  the policies 3 of Harry Truman.
applause And it is about time that we said to ourselves that we're ready to make a change on behalf of the future of our children and our grandchildren.
applause Emotionalism.
applause Raising her children was her most important job.
applause She is a fine member of the United States Congress.
applause And Americans are being vigilant  themselves.
applause We're going to double the number of people over 65 in 30 years  I hope to be one of them.
applause And so it's something that is worth remembering.
applause Governor Brown  Mayor Hammond  ladies and gentlemen  I want to express my appreciation to all of you for having come down to the station to meet us.
applause I'll be out there to see you in a minute.
applause I will be back soon.
applause Not bad.
applause If you spend any time in politics  it doesn't take long to recognize all the different kinds of personality and style  and all the different ways legislators go about their work  and how they try to achieve their goals.
applause And  yes  Quincy  that's why we finally passed health reform in America --   -- reform that will begin to end some of the worst practices in the insurance industry this year.
applause In these difficult times  our country will be stronger if management and workers come together to resolve disputes and work together to provide quality service.
applause Appreciate you.
applause So I said well you know maybe it would make the difference  those four electoral votes.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause It's kind of natural  isn't it?
applause But if the murderers of Madrid intended to undermine the transition to democracy in Iraq  they will ultimately fail.
applause Stand up  guys  so everybody can see you.
applause It is not true.
applause We've given rights back to trade union members.
applause Our leaders were adrift  rudderless  and without a compass.
applause And as I've said from the outset  and repeated last night  one way to give people a real choice when it comes to their health care and keep insurance companies honest  is by making one of the options available in such a marketplace a non-for-profit public option.
applause Is that right?
applause Real incomes and real wages are growing.
applause And when it comes to defending freedom  they will find out that this nation is determined and steadfast.
applause And that's what we're going to do.
applause Finally  I want to thank the Gatlin boys --   -- for bringing their mother.
applause So we decided that we would go back and change the DFAS process  not to pick communities -- we didn't know who would win and who wouldn't -- but to give special consideration to communities that had suffered from base closings.
applause So we're going to give you $2 600 a year to spend as you see fit getting an education and finding a new job so you can get a better job with higher skills and a brighter future.
applause Another way we can help them is by steering them away from risky behavior  and guiding them toward the knowledge and the self-respect they need to build successful lives.
applause So let me say  on behalf of the American people  welcome to the United States of America.
applause Thomas Jefferson said that if the people know all the facts  the people will never make a mistake.
applause It's such a noble profession and I appreciate you lending your expertise to help youngsters learn what is possible and how to think  and how to be creative.
applause Thank you.
applause Where have we reached?
applause I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers  and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.
applause But let me just tell you this -- I want to remind you all  we fight for freedom.
applause I'm very grateful that this is a country in better shape than it was seven years ago when I first came here.
applause That's the system the Founders put in place in the original Constitution.
applause But I want to talk about two things  two principles.
applause She was very good.
applause It looks like I'm going to end up with something.
applause And we're here today to make absolutely certain that Dino Rossi is the next Governor of the state of Washington.
applause And in our second term  we'll continue to work to pass a comprehensive energy policy to make the nation less dependent on foreign sources of energy.
applause Congressman Sodrel has a strong record of commitment to Indiana's young people.
applause Democrats and Republicans.
applause I want to thank Congressman Bob Filner for that rousing speech  and for the wonderful service he gives to you  to California and to our nation every day in the United States Congress.
applause Congratulations.
applause She said  and I love this quote  "If you're determined and you want to work hard  you can do anything you want to.
applause I just say  come with me.
applause But these are women -- and little people -- that I admire --   -- and I respect.
applause Bill 50 years ago with the student loan program improvements  and saved $8 billion for our kids with the HOPE scholarship  which gives every family a $1 500 tax credit on the cost of college tuition -- just about covers community college  makes it free in most states in the country.
applause So we let him talk a little bit.
applause Immediately  Canadians opened their homes and their hearts.
applause That is a goal ATLA has always set.
applause I would also like to ask three family representatives who are here -- Sam Doner is represented by his daughter  Gwendolyn Cox.
applause So I ask all of you to continue to support the work we're doing there.
applause I suggest in the future in cancer  in heart disease  diseases of the nerves  psychiatric diseases  all the rest  can all be attacked in the same way that polio was  by the cooperation of private foundations  doctors working  and by a government which provides stimulus to this research which will make the lives of our people happy.
applause Every morning  I'm reminded that my most important job in this day and age is to make sure our government  the federal government and all governments at all levels  do everything we can to prevent a further attack on the good people of this country.
applause I believe -- I believe we need to remember who paid the money in the first place.
applause And most of all I will bring us back together as one America.
applause And we thank her for joining us here today.
applause Jane Sullivan  a retired public schoolteacher and a former VISTA volunteer --   -- who helps rural communities gain better access to health care  housing and other assistance.
applause We have liberated people.
applause Where's John?
applause And nearly $50 billion more in lower car payments and in college loan payments.
applause America will prosper  America will succeed  he was saying  only so long as she is good.
applause And we're very proud of that.
applause We freed over 50 million people.
applause Minimum wage  housing  unemployment compensation  and in the last session of the Congress in August  when we brought up a bill for medical care for the aged  we received 45 Democrats and 1 Republican who supported it  and we were told it would be vetoed if it passed.
applause Now  the second thing I would like to say is I thought Alexis Ettinger was gangbusters --   -- wasn't she wonderful?
applause We need an America that is growing.
applause We live in a period of incredible consequence for our country -- with difficult issues  with big debates  decisions that require not just toughness but wisdom.
applause Next  we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking  spread by multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns.
applause Thank you.
applause Government is not going to be the primary driver of job creation in this country.
applause During these two-and-a-half years  we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security to better safeguard our borders and ports and to protect the American people.
applause I think it's important to remind the troops that we believe in them  we believe in what they're doing  and we're going to back them one hundred percent.
applause But perhaps most important  Kit understands economic growth and jobs.
applause You can make the greatest possible contribution  and in return we will work  this country and this State  from one end to another.
applause So we're here to thank you.
applause It is wonderful -- it is wonderful to be back in California.
applause It has been voted out of committee unanimously.
applause Because free nations do not support terror; free nations do not attack their neighbors; free nations do not threaten the world with weapons of mass murder.
applause The fourth thing we have to do is to make sure we give all our kids a world-class education.
applause God bless you  sir.
applause She had a remarkable way of making literature come to life.
applause I was watching him on the debate the other night and thinking that I knew exactly what he was going to say before he said it.
applause A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation.
applause We have to do better than this if this great bureaucracy of ours  if this great Government of ours  is going to function in the sixties.
applause The Mayor of Albuquerque is here  I know that he's working on it.
applause He was for a strong America.
applause We've got 10 million people with a minimum wage increase.
applause As well  we have a duty to make a commitment to America's seniors by strengthening and modernizing Medicare.
applause They asked good questions and it made me feel good about it.
applause The enemies of freedom are not idle  and neither are we.
applause Lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages  car payments and credit card rates to ordinary citizens.
applause Our communities and families are stronger.
applause In others  we're fighting through diplomacy  financial pressure  or special operations.
applause End quote.
applause Steadier prices  more jobs and good family life  all are vital  but all are at risk without the rule of law in our nation and without strong defences in a dangerous world.
applause Those regimes chose defiance  and those regimes are no more.
applause So  anyway  I gave them a few anticipations.
applause And know your part in this is that they've seen programs like this in action.
applause You were here this week to talk in real terms about what you can do to build better homes and better communities and better schools and better tomorrows for our children.
applause I also am challenging Congress to help.
applause Thank you all  may God bless you and may God bless America.
applause to keep the President's sensible  mainstream nominees off the bench.
applause The obligations -- the obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear.
applause I can't believe that any Democrats live in Lake Zurich - do they?
applause Thank you all for being here and I'm very glad to see you.
applause It's very clear.
applause They are four first class new members.
applause For eight months I've been begging the Congress to do it and they still haven't done it.
applause Last month  I met with Carol Schneider  who owns a temporary employment agency in Grafton  Wisconsin.
applause He said  "I sincerely pray that if you fail to hear from me for a while you will recall the words of the Gospel: 'A little while and you shall not see me  and again a little while  and you shall see me.'
applause I'm an abolitionist  and I bet you're not surprised.
applause But what sets America apart is the fact that we can make of our lives what we will.
applause More people own homes than ever before.
applause And I'm proud to congratulate you on your winning strategy and a winning team.
applause It is clear from all the research that children who come from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are most likely to have permanent learning gains when small classes are provided so they can get individualized instruction in the early grades.
applause We haven't solved all the problems by any means  but we've made some significant progress.
applause You can be proud of help -- to liberate the good people of Afghanistan from the thugs who turned that country into a training camp for al Qaeda terrorists.
applause And I also want to say a word about the upcoming special election for Congress here in South Dakota.
applause Isn't that great?
applause Listen  people who have been harmed by a bad doc deserve their day in court  no question about it.
applause Florida has been well served by state and local officials  by FEMA personnel  by members of the National Guard  and first responders.
applause Thank you all for joining us.
applause We're proud of you  Mason.
applause Let's give her a big hand.
applause And are we going to channel that anger and that frustration we feel sometimes  understanding that Michael is not part of the problem  he's part of the solution --   -- and that he's somebody who is going to change Washington if you send him back there and give him the kind of mandate that he deserves?
applause I don't have to say this.
applause I want to begin by thanking you for that wonderful welcome.
applause If elected  Senator Kerry has promised to repeal the Bush tax cuts during his first 100 days in office.
applause Tonight I ask for your support on the basis of the better  fairer  more prosperous America we can build together.
applause It moved not just me but my entire staff.
applause But he can't do it.
applause I love him to death.
applause The beheading of American hostages this week is another grim reminder of the evil nature of our adversaries.
applause As you know  there are some voices in the land who want to roll back the Bush tax cuts.
applause All these things must be done  but they won't be done until we have rejected the coalition politics of selfishness  and adopted the community politics of principle.
applause And I would say that those of you who had the opportunity to see and hear him represent us at the United Nations will agree with the statement I am about to make and that is that no man as a more experience  no man could have done a better job  standing courageously and representing articulately the cause of peace and freedom than Henry Cabot Lodge  our candidate for Vice President of the United States  and our Ambassador to the U.N.
applause My administration shares a strong commitment with the AJC to make sure relations between Israel and America remain strong.
applause I run for the Office of the Presidency recognizing that the Presidency is the wellspring of action in the American constitutional system.
applause I've got a couple of people I want to acknowledge.
applause In two-and-a-half years  we have done a lot.
applause But I'm here this morning as a pinch-hitter for him and on behalf of the Heritage Foundation.
applause When you call  he'll be on the other end of the line.
applause So how does this affect you?
applause That was my focus last year and that is my focus this year: to lay a foundation for economic growth that will create jobs  that raises incomes  that will foster a secure economic future for middle class families.
applause We will always seek international support for international efforts  but as President Bush has made very clear  there is a difference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few.
applause So a right without a remedy is just a suggestion.
applause He knows that social security has never had a better friend than the Eisenhower administration  and it will never have a better friend than the Nixon administration in the next 4 years as well.
applause The President and I know better than that.
applause So thank you  Sarah and Colin and Carolina.
applause His career covered the administration of three great Democratic Presidents of this century  and I must say that Alben Barkley  when he came before the Democratic Convention in 1948  and they played that song "My Old Kentucky Home " and he lifted a defeated convention to the heights  he spoke for the Democratic Party like I do today.
applause Thank you and God bless you.
applause And in the years to come  all Americans will be fortunate to have his service as our United States Ambassador to Ireland.
applause No  I don't.
applause But if He has a place and a part for us  I believe that we are ready.
applause My husband believes that there is more to do to make our country safer  stronger and more hopeful.
applause We can't jeopardize that  but we can afford a family-friendly tax cut  a $500 tax credit for children under 13  the education tax deductions that I just mentioned  and an IRA available to families making up to $80 000  moving up to $100 000 a year  that you can withdraw from without any penalty to buy the first home  to deal with a medical emergency and to educate your kids or yourselves.
applause And part of honoring the past was setting aside millennial treasures  a lot of which are important landmarks of the civil rights movement -- Abraham Lincoln's summer home at the Old Soldiers' Home; Harriet Tubman's cottage up in New York; a lot of other places.
applause And one of those essential tools is the Patriot Act  which authorizes federal law enforcement to share more intelligence information  to track terrorists  to disrupt their cells  and to seize their assets.
applause Good to see Hector Barreto.
applause I'm concerned about our future.
applause Nearly ten years—yet it's still we Conservatives who set the pace  generate the ideas  and have the vision.
applause Forty years ago  the great city of Los Angeles launched John Kennedy and the New Frontier.
applause Thank you  everybody.
applause These are still dangerous times.
applause But tonight  I want to ask you when you leave here  if you don't agree with me  that the number one characteristic of the world is interdependence and the number one job of the world is to move from interdependence to integrated communities of shared responsibilities  benefits and values  then you need some other way to look at the world.

applause Reverend Dr. Hoover  who pastors the largest church in Cleveland  who's here today  and all of the ministers got together and got behind this program.

applause Some in Congress  I note  are saying that because this is an election year  we really shouldn't try to do anything for the American people.
applause We now know something we didn't know 20 years ago  when I started working on this.
applause Mary  you should stand up  because these kids should know who you are because you're working hard.

applause They want to repeal that reform  take us back to the days when insurance companies could deny you care?

applause The grandson of Dr. Sloan  William Milligan Sloan  is here today.

applause In the last few months  the cost of living has reached an alltime high.

applause Under the leadership of Vice President Gore  we've reduced the federal payroll by 300 000 workers  cut 16 000 pages of regulation  eliminated hundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every government agency.
applause I've been looking forward to this event.
applause And we need to fill the gap.
applause I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis -- broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency  as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.
applause I want him to tell the people in this area  where there is over 9 percent of the people out of work  a quarter of them for more than 15 weeks  I want him to come on that slogan of peace and prosperity.

applause Economic progress will demand much patience.
applause We'll need you to work as hard as you can  and do as much as you can  driven by the belief that has always summed up the spirit of our youth -- three simple words: Si  se puede –- Yes  we can.
applause I'm proud of you.
applause That's what AmeriCorps is about.
applause Just think how rich I'd be if I'd saved that thing.
applause Part of it has to do with making sure you get to keep more of your own money.
applause And with George W. Bush leading this nation  we are serious and we will not let down our guard.
applause First that this country was enjoying unequaled prosperity.
applause I want to say  Mayor  it's always good to be with you and be in your city.
applause When I ran for President I found people all over America frustrated and angry by the crime problem  but nearly resigned to it.
applause Our country has the finest health care system in the world  and nurses are the heart of that system.
applause So I'm feeling kind of at home here.
applause I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is.
applause And we wage this fight with good allies at our side  including an Iraqi Security Force growing in size and ability.
applause But it is just the beginning.
applause In the U.S. Congress  Peter and Dave will support tax cuts.
applause That didn't make any sense.
applause Responsible candidates understand that the men and women of our military are risking their lives overseas  and that we must conduct the debate here at home in a way that does not jeopardize our troops in harm's way.
applause That's a good deal.
applause I think we can do a better job.
applause Howell knows I used to be a Democrat myself.
applause A lot of middle class families have disabled children who get a little help from Medicaid.

applause Listen  David  I've made a career out of people underestimating me.

applause Except I'm pretty -- I'm pretty sure you were happy to get the phone call.
applause It's about the millions of lives that would be touched and  in some cases  saved  by making health insurance more secure and more affordable.
applause Thank you.
applause Across the nation  the results of the President's policies are clear.
applause And that means having a smart electricity grid that can take all that good energy from solar and wind and take it from a place like South Dakota down to Chicago  into a garage  where somebody is then plugging in that plug-in hybrid that's getting 150 miles per gallon of gas  which will lead us to energy independence; it will lead to jobs right here in the United States of America.
applause Whenever and wherever your service took place  you earned the nation's respect on the first day you put on the uniform.
applause We know that it's a lot easier for America's businesses to hire new workers if they don't have to keep hiring lawyers.
applause If there's one thing I have learned in my travels around the world  it is that intelligence and ability and goodwill are evenly distributed across the planet.
applause This is the place where I've often been at odds with the incumbent government because I favored putting America in the International Criminal Court system  once our soldiers were protected.
applause I first want to acknowledge Congressman Jim Davis.
applause Over the last three quarters  rate of growth in the economy has been 5.5 percent -- the fastest pace since Ronald Reagan's first term in the White House.
applause The policies we pursued before 9/11 didn't impose any price on the terrorists  didn't ever wrap up those who support terror  and of course  didn't do anything to discourage the attacks because we got hit on 9/11.
applause But September 11th showed us  as surely as anything can  that we must act against gathering dangers  not wait for the next attack.
applause We have opened up our house to you  of all of our employees.
applause If the leaders of Hamas desire the help of America and the international community to build an independent  prosperous Palestinian state  then the way forward is very clear.
applause Milosevic is a thug and a tyrant  but that is not his country we destroyed  that is their country.
applause A priority in the budget is to make sure the people who don't have health care insurance who work have health care insurance.
applause But when I got to the rally over at Auditorium Shores there was a crowd of over 20 000 people –- 20 000 people.
applause If not for America  who would rally a great coalition and work to end the horrific international crime of human trafficking?
applause There are still too many of our children who graduate from high school not knowing that.
applause In order to generate more jobs and to maintain economic growth  we also need to create certainty in the tax code.
applause His death is one more reminder that this is not an enemy we can reason with  or negotiate with  or appease.
applause I can tell you that there is this popular feeling  I think  that nearly everybody who goes off to Washington has something bad happen to them and forgets about the folks back home -- they do not.
applause But I don't want people denied their chance to serve because of their race or their politics.
applause We cannot long survive in a nation with young people for whom the people has no allure and on whom the future has no claim.
applause But of course  we want the story of survivors to be longer and one day we want the stories not to be of survival but to be of cure.
applause So I say once again today that this Government will never surrender to the IRA.
applause I want him to tell the thousands of families in Pennsylvania who wait every month for a surplus food package from the Government  which is some rice  some flour  some dried eggs  all adding up to $6.25 for a family of four every 30 days  5 cents per person in the State of Pennsylvania  not India  not Russia  not Latin America but here in Pennsylvania and West Virginia - nearly 5 million Americans wait every month for those packages  and finally this summer they added lard to it.
applause Thank you  everybody.
applause Please be seated.
applause You know  I have a -- I don't get to watch a lot of kind of extra television  but the other night  just by accident  I was watching a news program where a special was being done on the minimum wage.
applause That means  then  that we will move forward in education.
applause Would you all stand up and be recognized?
applause You know  we meet here today  as graduating classes have met for generations  not far from where it all began  near that old oak tree off Emancipation Drive.
applause Thank you and God bless you all.
applause And a lot of that research is going on here at the University of Wisconsin.
applause And to encourage more U.S. companies to see Africa's opportunities firsthand  I propose holding the next AGOA Forum in Africa to coincide with my visit.
applause We ran on the slogan of the new freedom with Woodrow Wilson.
applause I should have gone in for wrestling earlier before I had to do it for a living.
applause We tend to think of them as the distant dramas of a different country.
applause Pretending it is not is naive.
applause I'd like to make you a trillion dollars worth of promises  too.
applause You also have effective  determined management -- the kind of leaders who care about long-term results and are willing to take intelligent risks to create new business.
applause I would like to thank the large number of Americans who are here with me  including six members of our Congress.
applause The first is a solar energy technologies program that will help replicate the success of the Nellis project in cities and states across America -- because in this case  what happens in Vegas should not stay in Vegas.
applause Do you know the person?
applause But here's the thing.
applause If we were Methodist and some others  we had been sprinkled.
applause Going forward  we'll see more growth and new jobs when the President's comprehensive energy policy becomes law.
applause And Michelle can tell you the transformation that occurred in her life as a consequence of being able to follow her passions  follow her dreams.
applause Well  thank you very much.
applause This is the kind of leadership we need; not the faint-hearted leadership that others are giving.
applause Thank you so much and God bless you all.
applause That mind set is dangerous.
applause Jan White is with us.
applause By the end of the campaign  he'd even convinced me to vote for him.
applause Exports are growing.
applause He talked about changing the world we live in  and about the need to transform the systems of government so that all citizens are equipped  prepared and free to make choices and to pursue their own dreams.
applause People ask me all the time  Mr. President  what great new idea did you bring to economic policy?
applause He fought in World War II  like Senator Dole -- my dad.
applause Patrick."
applause We remain the most prosperous  powerful nation on Earth.
applause That's why I ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo; that's why I prohibited the use of torture --   -- because America is stronger than any enemy -- and we always have been -- precisely because we do what's right not just when it's easy  but when it's hard.
applause But there were those who had another vision  a vision of a Jewish state that would shelter its children  defend its sacred homeland  turn its desert soil green and reaffirm the principles of freedom and democracy.
applause What do we want?
applause The deficit's going down three years in a row for the first time since Truman.
applause Because however you stand on the question of gay marriage -- and I realize that San Francisco is different from the rest of California  is different from the rest of America.
applause And of course  that's exactly what happened in 1990 and '91  and then he voted against Operation Desert Storm.
applause I want to continue to support all these projects.
applause Forget the lessons of September the 11th  trust a madman  or take action to defend our country.
applause I liked the way he won the primary  and I have to say I also really admire the way his principal opponent John Larsen came over and endorsed him and is trying to help him get elected.
applause And if we're going to conquer the great new frontiers of science and space in the future  Government must play its part; but it must encourage the best of individual enterprise in this country  and there again ---
applause Governor Ashcroft  Representative Bill Emerson  Carolyn and Kit Bond  and ladies and gentlemen  it's great to be back in Missouri  and it's great to be in America's heartland.
applause Hello  Boston!
applause And the economy is getting better.

applause Thank you.
applause That's what democracy is all about.
applause I want to thank the two Missouri senators for supporting this incredibly important piece of legislation.
applause Now it is a rising democracy  an ally in the war on terror  and the American people are safer for it.
applause This bill would not have happened without her leadership.
applause A movement for change.
applause Jan did superb work putting this event together  and I will henceforth always refer her as the "Goddess of Teton Village."
applause We took $68 billion -- $68 billion -- that would have been going to financial middlemen to pad their profits  even though they weren't taking any risks -- because these were all federally guaranteed loans -- and we said  why don't we use that to make college more affordable and to strengthen our community colleges  which are a pathway for so many working families to success.
applause I hope to be a useful citizen when I'm no longer living in the White House.
applause They don't deserve to be discriminated against because of their race.

applause Terry Branstad and Bob Ray have served your state so very well  and I appreciate their friendship.
applause And so it's tough being an incumbent.
applause Work hard.
applause They deserve people like Kevin Jett.
applause I think it would be no offense to any of our colleagues if I would say that  at least when I left the governorship in 1992 -- I think it was true then  I think it is true now -- there is no governor in America more respected or who has accomplished more than Roy Romer  not a single one in either party.
applause And the world is much safer as a result.
applause On issue after issue  this administration has acted on principle  has kept its word  and has made progress for the American people.
applause From the beginning  America has sought -- and received -- international support for our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
applause We must respond in two ways: We must keep pursuing a pro-growth agenda  because faster growth will create new jobs and generate more revenue for the government  and we must maintain spending discipline on non-priority items in Washington  D.C.
applause I want to close 500 more so we can look every child in the face and say  son or daughter  you're going to grow up next to a park  not poison.
applause You did pretty well.
applause You're proving that it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks about you or what you can achieve.
applause And to change we have to give our people security again.

applause And beginning in 2006  all seniors will be able to get prescription drug coverage under Medicare.

applause Thank you for supporting this good man.
applause I think we serve this country  and our party serves the country  when we tell the truth  when we present the facts  honest and clearly  and give the American people an opportunity to make their judgment.
applause All they can say is what McKinley and Taft and Coolidge and Landon and Harding and the others wanted to say.
applause On the stage with me  we've got some -- the reason we're here -- people who have helped to live out the American Dream and created jobs.
applause Of course  it was not the issue of unemployment which dominated the agenda.
applause It seems appropriate to do on the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall  after all  we couldn't have won the Cold War without you.
applause That's why we need a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that will stand up not for big banks  not for financial firms  but for hardworking Americans.
applause Dick Cheney and I made this promise.

applause I know how to say it.
applause And that work goes on.

applause I think they've got a good chance to get to Charlotte  but I can't promise to cheer for them if they play Arkansas.
applause Keep in mind  when we started out with Thomas Jefferson's credo that all of us are created equal by God  what that really meant in civic political terms was that you had to be white  you had to be male  and that wasn't enough -- you had to own property  which would have left my crowd out when I was a boy.
applause Thank you  Mike.
applause Thank you so much.
applause Now  on that basis  you must make your judgment on November 8.
applause Take what's left and invest it in education  health care and the environment  and a tax cut we can afford for average Americans for child care  long-term care  college tuition and retirement savings.

applause But this evening  Mr. President  I have no such inhibitions about being complimentary about everything about the United States.
applause He said  and I quote  "I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it."
applause That's an exact quote of John Kerry.
applause Senator Kerry does not.

applause In this period of extraordinary danger  President Bush has made clear America's purposes in the world  and our determination to overcome the threats to our liberty and our lives.
applause You and I together  we're going to build one America that works for everybody.
applause Terrorists declared war on the United States of America  and war is what they got.

applause I want to thank DJ Rekha who's been spinning a little East Room Bhangra for everybody --   -- mixing a hip-hop beat with the sounds of her heritage; making a uniquely American sound that may not have been heard in the White House before.
applause You don't govern by the polls; you govern by principles.
applause And God bless the United States of America.
applause In a partnership with the states.
applause The reason we can say that is because we in this country  and we will see that NATO holds to the same  will never let down our defences so that whatever happens the defence of liberty is sure.
applause Thank you very much  Your Highness  President de Masi  it's nice to meet a President who's not term-limited.
applause Your role has been decisive in this and I wish to thank also the Ministers  the Ministers for Foreign Affairs  the Secretary of the Foreign Office; also the specialised Ministers who have extremely well followed the intricacies of the whole problem and  Madame  at the same time my thoughts are very much for the United Kingdom and I wish to express the best wishes which we can express for the United Kingdom and I want to say at the same time how very much  in the name of France  this hospitality is close to our hearts.

applause He is not a steadfast leader.
applause Many say that this generation of college graduates is filled with pessimism  with a sense of generational despair that our glory days are behind us.
applause But I think the question we should be asking ourselves now  particularly with all the financial turmoil going on in the rest of the world  is what are we to make of the success America has now?

applause One old habit is war.
applause And I know that all that they respect is strength.

applause Because we know that there's still far too many Americans who are out of work; too many Americans seeing their hours and their wages cut; too many Americans who still don't have health care  and if they've got health care  they're seeing their insurance companies more worried about turning a profit than maintaining coverage.
applause God save the Republic  and God bless America.
applause And I had the high honor of being Ronald Reagan's second in the Panama Canal debates  and of being at his side when that great president refused to give up missile defense for his country and walked out of the summit at Reykjavik in Ronald Reagan's finest hour of the Cold War.

applause And we can't let it get worse as those of us in the Baby Boom generation move toward our retirement years.
applause So  if we have to ride two horses at once  shouldn't they both be headed in the same direction?
applause I've been telling people what I intend to do for the next four years  but the most -- probably the most important reason to put me back in is so that Laura will be the First Lady for four more years.

applause It's a big issue in this country today.
applause And my outstanding Secretary of the Interior  Ken Salazar.
applause But somehow I feel I should call her General.
applause And ladies and gentlemen  that is only one of the reasons that it is now my great pleasure and personal privilege to present to you a leader who has made unprecedented commitments to this nation's science and technology; a leader who is making sure that every student and every family in America will have the opportunity to participate in our limitless technological future.
applause It shows the American people that if you set aside partisanship and focus on good public policy  we can accomplish things on behalf of the American people.
applause That's what I think our simple set of values should be.
applause All the things the NRA --   Let me tell you -- but the NRA was wrong.
applause They show that America's economy has added 6.8 million jobs since August of '03.
applause And the very first act of the triumphant Russian revolution was to proclaim a state of peace with all mankind  coupled with a fervent moral appeal  not to kings  not to emperors  rulers or diplomats but to the people of all nations.
applause That's a good record.
applause Today  40 percent of American institutions are eligible to participate in that.

applause This idea  of course  did not immediately find favor.
applause Poland  the United States and our allies have agreed to extend NATO eastward and southward  bringing the peace and security of our alliance to the young democracies of Europe.

applause It is an attempt by force to prevent others from doing what they have a right to do.
applause I appreciate Major General Marty Dempsey's introduction  and his wife  Deanie.
applause And today we announced that we were setting aside eight more national monuments  which means this administration has now protected more land than any administration in the history of the country  except that of Theodore Roosevelt.
applause It's an interesting thing.
applause He has even said that by using our strength  we are creating terrorists and placing ourselves in greater danger.

applause A priority is going to be public education  as well.
applause Thank you.
applause Oh  I know you've heard the talk -- I certainly have heard it -- about how any kind of tax relief that has got any meaning to it will mean somebody is not going to get their Social Security check.
applause We raised the minimum wage and are trying to do it again to try to help people on the lower end of the economic ladder who are working hard.
applause You know what I thought?

applause For the first time in over 20 years the wages of all groups of Americans  all income groups  are on the rise.
applause I think we must develop our natural resources.
applause And I know what it means in the history of our country  because the UAW  as many have noted  is not only an active force for a better way of life for working men and women when it comes to bargaining sessions  when it comes to organizing  when it comes to wages  it has also historically been at the forefront of the progressive movement to have better health care and environmental protection and education and rights for women and minorities and social justice and a better country.

applause You can count on him  especially in a crisis.
applause This enemy will not be restrained by mercy  or by conscience.
applause But what I'm about to say doesn't come as a secret or as a surprise to anybody within the sound of my voice  and that is that Howard Dean really is the only candidate who has been able to inspire  at the grassroots level all over this country  the kind of passion and enthusiasm for democracy and change and transformation of America that we need in this country.
applause You know the steel industry is booming in America today  partly because the auto industry is booming in America today.
applause We must develop cleaner technology to explore for supplies of energy at home in environmentally friendly ways.
applause It's a battle we are going to win.
applause I think he is here today  and I thank him for his work.
applause And we're grateful to the 116th Air Control Wing - National Guard  active duty Air Force -- a unit that has been constantly deployed in support of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq  flying the J-STARS aircraft to locate  classify  and track ground targets.
applause First of all  it was the Republicans in Washington that once championed these community development grants.
applause These violent acts are grim reminders of why our work to defeat terror and to support free societies in the Middle East is so important.

applause So we're going to have to do everything we can to help you.
applause I thank all the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for their service to our country.
applause We've got a Cabinet Secretary  we've got a governor  a mayor.
applause When it comes to these new technologies  our nation is on the right track  and that's one of the reasons we're the world's leading exporting country again  one of the reasons we have as many jobs as we do  one of the reasons that more than half of our new jobs are in higher-wage categories -- because we are on the cutting edge of positive change.
applause It was Ross Perot who talked about it.
applause You know  some in the Congress are saying  well  Mr. President  your plan is too little.
applause But  my fellow sportsmen  this cover-up isn't going to work because you and I know the Second Amendment is more than just a photo opportunity.

applause We made 25 million Americans eligible to keep their health insurance  even if somebody in the family has been sick  and even when they move from job to job  under the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill.
applause I know these days that it's popular because it sort of satisfies the touchy-feely instincts that are so characteristic of people in the West these days--that  first of all  "well  if you're at war  what do you desire?
applause I will order an immediate review of our overseas commitments in dozens of countries.
applause Their courage and fortitude are in the highest tradition of our Diplomatic Service.
applause She is  as some person -- somebody said  "wicked smart."

applause And of course  the conclusion that leads to is if he can't stand up to the pressure of Howard Dean in the Democratic primaries  how can be possibly be expected to stand up to the likes of al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden?
applause And so I've had a very full and fascinating week.
applause Those regimes chose defiance  and those regimes are no more.
applause It matters; it matters; it matters.
applause The United States of America  and our coalition  will defend ourselves.
applause That's a very important principle that every American of any income ought to share.
applause This is absolutely vital to completing the task of making certain that those nations don't ever again become breeding grounds for terror  or for the development and use of weapons of mass destruction.
applause That is the postcard for what this election is all about  right there.
applause This is going to undermine our hunting culture.
applause Of course  your future is your own choice.
applause Well  anyway  somewhere --   -- somewhere between the Army Engineers and the Navy Seabees  you move over a half a million cubic yards of Earth.
applause It's good to be back.
applause Yet some of these nominations have been denied an up-or-down vote for months or even years.
applause Just last week  John Kerry gave us what I think is his eighth position on the war.
applause Let's think about what it's given us.
applause The federal government now allows faith-based groups to compete for billions of dollars in social service funding  without being forced to change their identity and their mission.
applause And so is America.
applause We have received  in return for what will soon be about $1 billion in federal matching money  over 2 800 proposals.
applause And she supports tax cuts.
applause It was not made on the basis of simply shooting from the hip  and I say today that in this critical period we cannot afford to use the White House as a training school for a man who's trying to gain experience at the expense of the American people.
applause We've been through a lot together these last four years.
applause Starting now  America is back at the bargaining table in full force.
applause We intend to continue the momentum  full-speed ahead  in the name of all Israelis.
applause The sacrifices of that terrible war were shared by both our countries  and helped forge our determination to resist tyranny wherever it exists.
applause Now what do yon know we will do Because we know Mr. Khrushchev  because we know the men that threaten the peace of the world  we will first be sure that America is always the strongest Nation in the world militarily.
applause In Europe last month  one of my last stops was Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo.
applause Yet  the plan he announced is not a plan; it's an echo of the strategy that President Bush laid out many months ago.
applause Yet we will use all our power to keep out the terrorists and the criminals so they can't hurt our citizens.
applause Yes!
applause And we need somebody in office who understands the future.
applause They don't see the house I'm running from.
applause But today  our economy is growing  we're closing the achievement gap in our schools  and America is safer and stronger thanks to the President's decisive leadership.
applause Manufacturing activity is increasing.
applause I want to congratulate this city.
applause These plans give small businesses the same kind of purchasing power and coverage as large firms  and they certainly deserve it.
applause We live in historic times  when the will and character of America are being tested.
applause Well our two states have relatively small populations; we're both steeped in history and heritage; we have very strong educational systems; we're home to diverse cultures; we're very independent  independent-minded individuals despite voter registration  our two states are barometers in the political system.
applause Give Roberta a big round of applause.
applause Nothing like somebody in the Congress who loves her family and who understands the importance of family values.
applause I want to see all that stuff right here in the United States of America  with American workers.
applause Thank you  Nancy  very much  for that kind introduction.
applause Okay.
applause Or best of all  he could call back Mr. Benson from his trips around the world  and debate agricultural policy and tell us how in one iota his agricultural policy differs from Mr. Benson's  just one iota.
applause Senator Kerry also said today that President Bush misled America in calling Iraq an imminent threat.
applause But none of them have decided that tolerance  none of them have decided that the desire to respect one another's religion means that we must turn our back on God  turn our back on His commandments  turn our back on the fundamental moral institutions that have been instituted by His law.
applause Thank you  George Miller  Norm Dicks  Maurice Henshey -- thank you for what you have done for our country.
applause We understand whose money we spend in Washington  D.C. We do not spend the government's money; we spend the people's money.
applause As you might recall  we had a recession  some corporate scandals  an attack on our country  a war  major hurricanes.
applause Sure  the Washington establishment was betting against him  but I can tell you the smart money was riding on a great Senator by the name of Dan Quayle.
applause But that issue of whether we are going to enforce the obligations that God's law says we all have toward each other and our children  that notion runs through every problem that we have--it's the welfare problem  it's the crime problem  it's the health problem  it's the problem of a people gone out of control who will lose their freedom if they do not respect the principles that will bring that control back to them again!
applause We grew up together  went to high school together there  and got married.
applause Jim supports the IDEA Act  which funds education programs for young people with disabilities in Pennsylvania and throughout our country.
applause And that is also very important.
