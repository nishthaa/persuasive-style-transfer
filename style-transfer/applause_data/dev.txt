nonapplause But I have to tell you that the longer I go on in this job and the more time I spend reading American history  as well as trying to think about the future  the more I realize that there are two or three basic functions that a political party has to fulfill at every point in our history.

applause We faced recession  terrorist attack  and the uncertainties that exist as a result of the war on terror.

nonapplause I just want to illustrate  use Enron  which is a fabulous and very large energy company  to illustrate a point that he made  that I think we should emphasize because it goes back to something John made.
nonapplause No  it really is.
nonapplause And my attitude is  well  if we're guaranteeing them  then where's the risk?

nonapplause The future of the American Dream and the fate of our economy and much of the world's economy hangs in the balance on what happens in this city in the next few months.
applause Then the other side shut down the government twice in order to turn back that program.
applause And when you put your troops in harm's way  you better have the best -- the best equipment  the best support  and the best possible pay.
nonapplause I know we can do this.
nonapplause Let's get going.
nonapplause First of all  as I go to the G-7 conference  there will be a lot of discussion about GATT.

nonapplause But they still like her a lot here.
applause Not only where the money is concerned  but also where the schools are concerned  where we're more and more allowing the national government to move in and take over control of education--and it's not because it produces better results  you have noticed that  right?
applause And I hope they're as proud of them as I am.
nonapplause And money  with me money is no object  because it's never been a subject.
applause You don't know what you've just done.
applause A great friend of mine  our of my earliest supporters  co-chair for Obama -- Nevadans for Obama  Steven Horsford.

nonapplause After 9/11  there was an effort made by KU to raise funds for the victims' children  and you were the first University to respond with  I think you gave to the Clinton-Dole team that time  we were raising money  $47 000 and we thank you for it.
applause Against this kind of determined  organized  ruthless enemy  America requires a new strategy  not merely to prosecute a series of crimes  but to fight and win a global campaign against the terror network.
nonapplause I appreciate the sincere motives of those who point out the faults of our friends and insist on reforms.
nonapplause And I loved my time in the House.

applause A court can make an order  but it was a child that had to walk the gauntlet of slurs and jeers into a school.
nonapplause And that  in fact  the attack on our plan is limiting choice is simply not true -- that by guaranteeing at least three choices and that you get to make a decision every year again  that we are building into this system a higher level of choice and  therefore  a guarantee of competition and quality that otherwise would not be the case.
nonapplause Three million people had left the farms in that period  just as they have in the last 8 years.
nonapplause Wasn't this Convention just designed to steal from the States their sovereignty  to usurp their freedoms so recently fought for?

nonapplause ﻿  Remarks of Vice President Nixon  Bridgeport Airport
nonapplause The second responsibility given to the President by the Constitution and by the force of events is the conduct of foreign affairs  and it is in this area that the great issues of war and peace  of strength and weakness  of ebb and flow will meet across the desk of the next President.

nonapplause And we took a lot of other tough decisions.
applause They take children of every background  from every part of the world  and prepare them for the obligations and opportunities of a free society.
applause And as always  decisions about troop levels will be made by the President -- driven by the conditions on the ground and the judgment of our military commanders  not by artificial timelines set by politicians in Washington  D.C.
nonapplause Will you help me build that bridge?
nonapplause You should be poked and prodded and the American people should be able to lift the hood and take candidates out for a test drive and see whether they meet the test.
nonapplause That's why we've invited you to the South Lawn.
nonapplause How are you going to educate all these kids?
nonapplause The death of an innocent unborn child has too often been treated as a detail in one crime  but not a crime in itself.
nonapplause This endeavour will create jobs in the building industry and will stimulate the achievements and  what is perhaps the most important thing  this will in a way bear witness to the spirit of enterprise and invention of our own generation  and this will in fact demonstrate that we can be as bold as our predecessors when required to do so and this will encourage our successors to effort and creativity.
applause Last week Hillary and I took a sad journey to Colorado to visit with the students and the families of Columbine High School.
nonapplause And if you look at it that way  you work hard  you get the job done  you spread the credit around  then you go on to the next problem.
nonapplause In 1984  when he ran for the Senate  he ran on a platform of cutting or eliminating most of the major weapon systems that President Reagan had acquired  or wanted to acquire  that were crucial to winning the Cold War and our military operations then.

nonapplause After a lifetime of service  he would have been forgiven had he settled for a life of quiet  a life of ease  a life of improved golf scores -- my understanding is they have not improved that much since he was in office.
applause And finally  let me say  I know this is one of the more controversial things I've been involved in  but I have strongly supported efforts to increase trade  like NAFTA  because you can't keep and generate more high-tech jobs unless you have more customers.
applause I believe that we should begin by giving Alma another hand.
nonapplause Every one of you has people that you work with  you go out to dinner with on the weekends  maybe you worship with  maybe you play golf with or go bowling with or your kids play soccer with  or some other way you come in contact with people.
applause If we let other countries have access to our markets  we should ask for the same thing in return  and give you a chance to compete in the global economy.
nonapplause My opponent has very different plans for your budget.
nonapplause Others would set out for capitals across the Middle East  spreading more sorrow and discord as they eliminate dissenters and work to undermine moderate governments.
nonapplause Ultimately we're the ones who influence our kids.
nonapplause But it begins with knowing who you are and knowing your own history  and to say that this is – we are part of a new generation.
applause Third  there will be no peace  and no peace agreement  unless the Israeli people have lasting security guarantees.
nonapplause But I also know how you've managed to meet them  and managed through them -- experimenting and innovating and finding new ways to increase productivity and better serve your customers.

nonapplause Let me be clear.
applause When it comes to spending your hard-earned money  they act like they've got your credit card in their pocket.

nonapplause And I think the right question is  what are we going to do with this magic moment of prosperity and improvement in our social condition?
applause You know it well.
nonapplause They're all giving us important support to cut back redtape impeding growth and new jobs.
applause We're going to bring some fiscal sanity to the budget.
nonapplause A lot of people think  well  we're collecting your money and we're holding it for you  and then when you retire  we're going to give it back to you.
nonapplause Let me just say a word or two  if I can  about where we are in terms of our ongoing operations.
nonapplause Those days are over.

applause There is no greater gift that a President can receive.
applause We haven't broken for the election yet.
nonapplause This matters.
applause Well  now we have had 8 years.
applause I don't believe that the American people are going to give their endorsement to the leadership which believes that medical care for our older citizens  financed under social security  is extreme  and I quote Mr. Nixon accurately - which he does not always do me.
nonapplause Because unlike science fiction  how this story ends is in all of our hands.
applause This is an overpayment of taxes and you are correct that those who paid it know better how to spend it than the Congress.
applause We can win the battle of freedom against tyranny.
applause We can pay for that and we ought to have it.
applause But he helped make this happen.
applause Never again will your fate be decided by others.
applause He knows we had the greatest progress in these 7½ years in every field that we've ever had in our history.
nonapplause He is a good man  and if you will work for a year  you'll make him a senator.
applause Thank you all for coming.
nonapplause Of course we all knew that when Mr. Callaghan said he could "see no reason why inflation should ever get back to double figures" he was simply whistling in the dark.
applause Not nearly enough.
nonapplause Let me remind you of something.
applause He both supported and opposed it.
applause You've got be very careful how you pronounce these words.
nonapplause So plenty of cities carry their sports teams through a tough season.
applause My administration is meeting the tests of our time.
applause Now  General Stein  I have to leave it to you to define which offenses are minor --   -- but on this day  even in this conservative age  I trust you will be fairly liberal in your interpretation of the term.
applause Never stop and forget that collectively  that means all of us together  collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world  with the exception of nine.
applause Thank you.
nonapplause The Basrah Children's Hospital Project is  of course  just one very promising part of a larger and hopeful picture.
nonapplause It took us nearly the entire first year to get our program approved and  even then  the tax cut had to be watered down.
nonapplause Thank you very much.
nonapplause The problem is simple to state: With an aging population  and a steadily falling ratio of workers to retirees  the system is on a course to eventual bankruptcy.
nonapplause Mike and his wife  Victoria  have carried on this tradition and passed it along to their own children -- Michelle  a cadet at the United States Air Force Academy  and Mark  who serves in the Air Force.
nonapplause Having served in foreign wars  you bore that duty in some of our nation's most difficult hours.
nonapplause Because we acted  that country is not a haven for terrorists  and the people of America are safer from attack.
nonapplause That's why  at the very beginning  President Bush went to the Congress and asked for major tax relief across the board  to reduce the burden on every person who works and pays income taxes.
applause Thank you.
nonapplause Did we do enough?
nonapplause The Democrats don't like that idea.
nonapplause And instead of putting more power and authority into the hands of bureaucrats and Federal officials in Washington  we chipped away at Federal regulations  eliminated much useless paperwork  and cut redtape.
nonapplause Yet  you not only survived and thrived  but held fast to the traditions of tolerance and openness upon which this nation was founded.
applause There's going to be somewhere between two and four justices appointed to the Supreme Court.
nonapplause We lost some 3 000 innocent lives that morning  in scarcely two hours' time.
applause That's right     My friends  don't let anybody make us feel that we are to be compared in our actions with the Ku Klux Klan or with the White Citizens Council.
applause I want to expand that to say that when a parent earns overtime  the parent should be able to decide to take the overtime in pay or in time with their kids  depending on what they need for the family.
applause We have had many heartwarming welcomes  but one that will stand out in our memories the longest was the one that we had on a Sunday afternoon in Warsaw right after our visit to the Soviet Union last summer.
nonapplause And this is more than just genetics at work.
applause We can help work to change the culture of Washington  and to kind of tone down  dial down the rhetoric and dial up success.
nonapplause The reason I asked them to come  because I want to just describe their circumstances quickly.
nonapplause Well  thank you very much  Mr. Chief Justice; Chief Judges Ginsburg and Hogan; judges of the district and circuit courts; Delegate Norton; ladies and gentlemen.
applause I'll tell you  there are a lot more who think you can win today  Senator  than when you started.

applause As the President has said  this nation needs more than a temporary expansion  so we need more than temporary tax relief.
nonapplause Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze will meet next week in Vienna.
nonapplause We're talking about people's lives.
nonapplause The second is  we say in return for more flexibility  you ought to be able to do the job for less money  so we won't increase the money you're getting over the next five years  which means we'll get to save money and lower the deficit.
nonapplause These are just a few.
nonapplause But just as important  thousands of able Republican women like you are serving in public offices all across America.
applause You want to make sure your friends and neighbors are registered  and your family is registered  that you take advantage of that tremendous privilege we have as Americans to participate in the political process to select our leadership  to hold them accountable for their performance.
nonapplause And the piece of legislation I signed is going to help people find jobs here in America.
nonapplause Teddy Roosevelt once put it this way: "The American people are slow to wrath  but when the wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame."

applause Al Qaeda's biggest supporters were driven from power and the people of Afghanistan are liberated from their oppressors.
applause There's 356 accounts that have less money this year to spend than they did last year.
nonapplause But these bills would give patients and their families a false sense of security.
applause A lot of them are over here on the side.
nonapplause This enemy  in the words of the 9/11 Commission report  is "sophisticated  patient  disciplined  and lethal."
applause And we should work to that end.
applause There might be places where you and I might disagree with the religion some folks wanted to put in place over their communities.
nonapplause It gave him a chance to learn diplomacy.
nonapplause All of this you understand  I'm quite sure  better than I.
nonapplause "There is no more insecure time in the life of an empire than when it is facing the devolution of its power; there is no more dangerous time in the life of a religion (Communism being after all a secular religion) than when it has lost its inner faith but retains its outer power."

applause It's always a great place to come back  and I want to  as well  bring good wishes to all of your today from your former governor  President George W. Bush.

nonapplause Number two  because he had a pivotal role in it.
nonapplause The inspections uncovered and destroyed more weapons and weapon stocks and missiles and warheads than were destroyed in the Gulf War.
nonapplause Do you believe we can do that?
nonapplause And if that isn't impressive enough  let it be noted that Howard's grandmother  Lillie "Mother Ladd" Mauser  was the first woman sheriff in the state of Tennessee.
nonapplause Then there's John Simpson  the Director of the Secret Service  the man who planned protection for all the Presidential candidates in 1984  for the Los Angeles Olympics  for the 40th anniversary celebrations at the United Nations  and who currently serves as President of Interpol.
nonapplause This is -- the fact that we did this in a bipartisan fashion  and we did it  to use Congressman Portman's words  based on trying to legislate nationally a system not only to empower people to do what we know works in some communities today already  but to give them the incentive to do more of it is I think a great thing.
applause It is a fact that America has more than 10 million more jobs.
nonapplause One brave member of the Italian Resistance said  "We cried with happiness  letting ourselves realize for the first time how scared we had been."

applause And to Ross DeLorenzo  who is an old friend of mine.
applause Freedom's cause is the right cause  and every action we take in support of it makes this world better and safer for our children.

nonapplause He's the director of the civil works of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer.
applause I kept my word.
nonapplause Mr. President  there are thousands of stories across our country just like these three stories.
nonapplause May I compliment you also on your most excellent speech and congratulate you on your election to this most distinguished office.
nonapplause And in Afghanistan  itself  Russia is helping to build hospitals and a better future for the Afghan people.

nonapplause You know that.
applause Thank you  thank you  thank you.
nonapplause Mr. President  I learned many things about you today.
nonapplause I mean it.
applause And the Marshall plan and NATO and the Truman Doctrine carried out in foreign policy under the administration of Harry Truman and point 4  all had their logical extension in the domestic policy of President Truman here in the United States.
nonapplause Why do I say that?
applause And we thank you.
nonapplause The result has been higher prices  higher unemployment  and lower productivity growth.
nonapplause Eight years ago  Mr. President  you pledged to join us on that journey.
applause And the reason why that enemy is a friend is because of freedom and democracy.
applause They said  either you spend it all or none of it.
applause Patrick  stand up and wave so we can all recognize you.
nonapplause I also intend to enact tough  common-sense regulatory reforms  equal to the challenges of a 21st century financial system  so that a crisis like this never happens again.
nonapplause Please  have a seat.
applause But guess what?
applause I am so proud tonight to say I am a proud member of the party  the Reform Party of America.

nonapplause And by the spirit of aloha I mean the example to all the world that people can live together in friendship  recognizing the dignity of men and women regardless of their background and Hawaii is the finest example of that for the whole world to see.
nonapplause That's the first problem.
nonapplause And we look forward to working with him for a long time to come.
nonapplause But in the final analysis it is our greatest source of strength.
applause And next year  you'll be able to count on a United States Senator named George Nethercutt.
nonapplause We began early in political life.
nonapplause It's is still the best description I know of what we are trying to do.
nonapplause And so for people like Nancy and Chris and all the members here to have stood up again and again and again under just fierce  withering criticism and opposition  and to do so with a smile on Nancy's face and with the grace with which she's done it  and for the members who have taken tough vote after tough vote over the course of the last two years  because they knew it was the right thing to do even when it wasn't the popular thing to do  that's why we're here tonight.
nonapplause They recognized  as Frederick Douglass once put it  that “education…means emancipation.” They recognized that education is how America and its people might fulfill our promise.
nonapplause And I've gotten a readout from some of the breakout groups and breakout sessions.
nonapplause The policy of this government is to streamline the security forces so there's only one authority with security forces  and that's the authority that campaigned based upon a peace platform.
nonapplause Of those directly involved in organizing the September 11th attacks  many are now in custody or confirmed dead.

applause We started out in September when the polls showed Kennedy leading 45 to 41.
applause Those regimes chose defiance and those regimes are no more.
nonapplause I think I should confess: I'm doing penance for all those wasted years before I --   Senator Evans  Congressmen Miller  Morrison  and Chandler  Bill Ruckelshaus  and you ladies and gentlemen  it's an honor for me to be here today in support of a courageous champion of good government and fiscal responsibility  your Senator  Slade Gorton.
nonapplause When you have a job  you keep it; and you settle for the terms that you have because you know you're blessed to even have a job.
applause I want to thank you all for your good service.
nonapplause As a consequence of that order  because of the tax credits made available  they're building another new 100 windmills out there.
nonapplause Then our fears are dispelled.
nonapplause But with these changes we must work harder to see that as we advance we don't leave behind our conscience.
applause Now about injunctions.
nonapplause Mr. Sabo  who was our chair  along with Senator Moynihan back in '93; and Congressmen Boyd  Brown  Edwards  Filner  Congresswoman Furse  Congressman Hastings  Hinojosa  Markey  Vento  Wise  and Congressman Thurmond for being here.
applause Therefore  in this city you connect the old with the new but the cause is still the same  the maintenance of freedom  the maintenance of self-government  at a time when it is under far more serious challenges than the city of ancient Troy ever faced.
nonapplause And may the President of the United States  whether he is a Democrat or a Republican  never feel it is necessary to apologize for protecting the security of the United States.
nonapplause So that's the second purpose  and again it wouldn't have happened but for us and the crime position would be infinitely worse now than it is.
nonapplause Let's remember that in the past years  when we have done that  we have been successful.
applause And I appreciate his support in making this world more free  making America more secure and making the world more peaceful.
applause Is there more to do?
nonapplause President Bush and I are both honored by your confidence in us  and by your commitment to the cause we share.
