Compare it with our opponent and then decide  and make the decision on that basis.
The evidence is that since the warming which followed the Ice Age  organisms have not so much adapted in response to climate change as migrated to where the climate was right and the calculation has been made that a one-degree rise in temperature would lead forests to move 100 kilometres further north and temperature-sensitive plants anything up to 300 kilometres further north.
But I got a letter from Jeanette Windham of Shreveport  and I had her come to the airport to meet me last night -- a woman who works for an insurance company who had a brain aneurism.

El Salvador is nearer to Texas than Texas is to Massachusetts.
And I thought that -- for the first time I had to think about life and the life that I was building for myself  and I had to ask myself whether  if I died tomorrow  would I want this to be my legacy  working in a corporate firm  working for big companies?

There is no country in this world as well-suited to seize the 21st century as the United States  if we will just remember how we got to where we are: by being a community  not a crowd.
We are nearing the adoption of a bold plan to reduce our public deficit by $500 billion over the next five years  and to increase our investments in education  in technology and in new jobs for the American people.
I also wanted to come because one of the primary reasons I ran for President is to do what I could in the White House to make a positive difference in the schools of America.
I see every day in my classroom just how hard my students work in order to pay their tuition bills.
Not all of you -- some of you.
Who wants to kind of re-live those days in your memory?
Northwest Arkansas is one of the fastest growing ares of America  has been for 20 years  and one of the most racially and religiously homogenous areas in the country.
In the second cycle of the summits  I have seen those policies widely adopted because they work.

You know and you've made -- I like that joke about how my administration doesn't look like the one on West Wing.

He has been very kind and generous to my family  and I thank him for that.
It can't last forever  where we are the dominant political economic and military power of the world.
But  particularly for the young people  I would say to you that you are living through an era of more profound change than any the United States has experienced in a hundred years in terms of the way we work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world  trading the Cold War for the global village  trading the Industrial Age for an Information and Technology Age  trading a lot of yesterday's problems for tomorrow's problems.

But it's a classic example of the difference in the two parties.
As your Commander in Chief  I know that you're charged with one of the most difficult missions in all our Armed Forces -- the defense of our nation and world peace across more than 100 million square miles  about 50 percent of the Earth's surface.
We shouldn't have two public school systems in America  one for the most affluent communities  one for everybody else.
Permit me now to turn to the Federal budget and tax reform.
Taken together  these actions give the United States a positive framework for leading our producers and trading partners toward more open markets  greater freedom  and human progress.

We understand and are sensitive to Latin American sympathies in this crisis  something which made our own decisions more painful and difficult.
President Bush wants to make it easier for high school students to take courses at community college and earn credits toward their degrees before they even graduate.
All of us have to change.
And now we have to be sensitive because all of our newer members are going to have to rely more on permanent staff people  and they're going to have to listen more to the lobbyists because they'll have information they don't have.
I think we'll also have to deal with highly sophisticated terrorists and organized criminals and drug runners that have access to chemical and biological and other weapons.
I was flattered to read that "understanding the new administration" is called a "central feature" of this year's meeting.
The Socialist myth is that we can make Britain strong by nationalisation and government interference.
I have done my best to see America stand on the forefront of world peace.
And on that matchbox was written the word -- one word in Italian -- “corragio” -– and it was courage.

﻿  Remarks by the President to the American Jewish Committee
Now  last month I submitted to Congress the first balanced budget in a generation.

But in America we must always be determined to change  to improve  to move forward.
We did not ask for this trial  but it has come  and we will see it through to victory.
Dangers originating far from Europe can now strike at Europe's heart -- so NATO must be able and willing to act whenever threats emerge.
And so  I ask all of you to leave here tonight with a sense of gratitude to Thomas Jefferson but also with the firm conviction that the thing he was most right about was in leaving us a system that would always be in the act of becoming  that his unshakable belief that the future could be better than the present extended even to himself and to his contemporaries -- to their failures and to their successes.
We will never have a better time to deal with Social Security and Medicare by setting aside the lion's share of this surplus to do so  or to provide for all Americans to have the opportunity to save  to invest  to create a share of wealth -- something most Americans can't afford to do  even with the enormous improvement in the stock market.
And I think its pretty convenient  and I hope it's an omen for the future -- the score at the half is tied 10 and 10.
Thanks for coming.
I'm sure all of that is simply to encourage the export of nutmeg.
But the thing that we want to feel like as black Americans is that we can have an opportunity  an equal opportunity.

For its part  the federal government sometimes spent more time haggling over regulatory details than it did working with states and cities to fix the problem.

Now  no matter how much you earned after that  Uncle Sam would never get more than 35 cents of each dollar that you earn.
When they wrote the Constitution  they got down to the end of the convention  they'd created this post called Vice President  but they hadn't given the guy anything to do.
And once again  all of us were reminded of the kind of enemies we face  the beliefs they hold  and the ambitions they want to achieve.
And  of course  we've got the problem today that we've still got spent fuel piling up at reactors all over the country because we've never completed the process of finding a permanent repository for that waste.

When traveling through countries of Europe  the Vice President of the United States  himself  when he went to Poland  a half million people turned out  and I am sure he would say himself not because he was the Vice President of the United States  but because the United States stands for something  and because they wanted to be free  too.
In between  he led the Treasury Department  oversaw two landslide victories in presidential politics  and served as our nation's 61st Secretary of State during a period of truly momentous change.
What have they done this year with their year in the Congress?

Americans appreciate our fellow citizens who go out on long deployments  endure the hardship of separation from home and family  go in harm's way for the nation.
Our opponents have a different vision for the economy.

And on the family track  just to let you know  because everyone always asks  that we've never been better.
As far as I can tell  that means this nation of ours must go to other nations to seek permission before we secure our defense.
We have to mount a great offensive for freedom.
That means we can't talk about the foundation of what we are.

When we concluded the side agreements with Mexico and Canada in the NAFTA negotiations and actually had a proposal to take to the Congress  I really believed that the cause was so self-evidently in the interests of the United States that after a little bit of smoke and stirring around  that the votes would rather quickly line up in behalf of what was plainly in our short and long-term national interests.

My grandfather marched off to Europe in World War II  while my grandmother worked in factories on the home front.
﻿  Remarks by the PresidentatDNC Presidential Gala
We're going to try to change the parameters of the debate.
Ammunition was low  and spare parts were in short supply.
Well  probably more than any other sport  baseball revels in statistics.
Let me tell you what I'm talking about.
Now  there are some earthier words  but balderdash will have to do.
If we can't bring investment and jobs to these places now  we will never get around to doing it.
What I'd like to do this morning is talk about a couple of basic areas  policy areas that I think are important.
Thank you all.
Thank you all.
The problem that we've seen is that union membership has declined significantly over the last 30 years.
But I don't think any of us fool ourselves into believing that what we do in our day and in our lifetime is gonna do more than contribute to that result.
There are a lot of good things.
General Douglas MacArthur  a leader I deeply respected  is said to have written that no man is entitled to the blessings of freedom unless he be vigilant in its preservation and vigorous in its defense.
There are over 250 schools with are open  100 more are going to open next year.
Because they thought they had the truth.
We shall remain—we shall not be ashamed to say—proud of our Party  proud of our country  proud of this United Kingdom.
Over a 7-year period ending in 1981  government spent $66 billion on so-called job programs  and during those 7 years  unemployment increased and the economy worsened.
And I want to quote -- I wrote this down -- usually when I come home I feel free to speak without notes  but I did want to write this down -- nearly seven years ago  this is really the test -- "to restore the American Dream  to fight for the forgotten middle class  to provide more opportunity  insist on more responsibility  and create a greater sense of community for our great country.
But a great deal needs to be done to ensure that democracy becomes a living reality for all citizens.
"So let me get this straight.
The first lesson was that they could strike us with relative impunity  because they had done it repeatedly and there had never been a very effective response from the United States.
When they wrote the Constitution  they created the post of Vice President  but they got down to the end of the convention  and they remembered suddenly they hadn't given him anything to do.
It's the belief that has brought millions of people to our shores  and carried us through even the toughest economic times.
This meeting was a breakthrough in our negotiations  our discussions  with the Soviets.
And as President Bush decided that very first night after 9/11  we also have to go after terror-sponsoring states  and that those who provide safe harbor and sanctuary for terrorists to launch attacks against the United States will be deemed just as guilty as the terrorists themselves for the attacks that have been launched.
It's a personal problem.
The fact is these are all manageable and preventable conditions.
You know  the truth is those people never saw a tax they didn't like.
Let us strive on to finish the work we are in  to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations!"
But I want you to know I've always had an admiration for the spirit of this State.
The first Mother's Day of the 21st century is shaping up to be a time of commitment and action  led by women in America.
Each of the Western countries has met the challenge of change in its own way.
Rather than attack environmental initiatives  we hope the Congress will work with us to craft policies that are as environmentally sound as they are economically beneficial.
In the words of that NES student back in 1993  the real world is not so rational as on paper.
We've got more strength than you have."
Jim Hunt said something today I want to emphasize.
One day the man was sitting with a young third niece-in-law  twice removed --   -- who'd ignored hint after hint that she'd overstayed her welcome.
And so  the tax plan we submitted is based upon some principles  as well.
Then one day the people came with the machetes.
When the President and I came into office  we inherited an economy that was headed into recession.
You serve this nation's ideals  and you live out those ideals in your code and in your character.
Blur  blur  blur.
There is a lot of fashionable nonsense talked about how we misunderstand Communism  misrepresent Communism  see Communists under every bed.
But this is no time to rest on our laurels.
To set it on the right path  the President worked with Congress to provide tax relief for the American people -- not once  not twice  but three times.
We know that.
Then  just 6 weeks ago  another newspaper boy  Eugene Martin  also disappeared.
Imagine boarding a train in the center of a city.
I'm proud to be with my old classmate  and I'm proud to be here to talk about a really important project for this part of the world.
And I thank you all for that wonderful California welcome.
You and I both know  I'm sure  as individuals  we prove it all the time  don't we?
If our children cannot get the world-class education they need to succeed  then America will not be able to compete with other countries.
Americans in uniform are currently serving in over 100 countries  and the military remains an active  visible sign of America's commitments around the world -- defending our interests  standing by our friends  keeping patient vigil against possible dangers  and  above all  directly engaging the enemies of the United States.
I have had the honor of working closely with several of this year's honorees  and the equal honor of receiving advice and  on occasion  criticism from them  as well.
Kathryn Sullivan made history  and she returned to a space shuttle in which some of the great scientific and medical advances of the future will be made and are being made.
And I really commend them for the fine company that they've built.
The fact that we have succeeded in stopping another attack on the homeland does not mean our country will not be hit in the future.
The case of Joe Lieberman is a perfect illustration of the basic philosophical differences between the two parties in the year 2006  and it's a reminder that the elections on November 7th will have enormous consequences for this nation  one way or the other.
What made it possible was that we stood from the beginning  on the belief  that our freedom comes from the hand of God and must be exercised with respect and responsibility toward His existence and toward His will.
The election did not commission me to attempt economic reform alone  but to work with elected officials -- Federal  State  and local -- to put America's economic house in order.
Sections of Louisiana and Florida can be flooded.
And it is no good saying that someone else should do it.
Our job would be easier without those outrageous interest rates – 21 and 1/2 percent -- that we inherited.
You know  when you talk about human life  I think that means seeing that the immeasurable pain of the Holocaust is never dehumanized  seeing that its meaning is never lost on this generation or any future generation  and  yes  seeing that those who take our place understand: never again.
However  the savings to the government and the improved service to other students offered by direct lending are of greater importance.
﻿  Remarks by the President at Screening of Ken Burns' "lewis and Clark"
He said  we have the finest health care system in the world.
I think it is worth the investment.
As the Vice President said  we're not just talking about computer networks  but billions of imbedded chips built into everyday products.
When Congress comes back in September  everyone in Washington will be facing problems that have been with us for a while.
This guide helps concerned adults learn more about the problems facing youth in their own communities  and what local resources they have that are available to address these problems.
I hope that together we may be equally successful this week about agreeing a budget for 1987.
See  I'll bet you a lot of you could do the same thing I just did  and that's probably why you're doing what you're doing today.
Only four.
There's a wise saying: We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.
I'd like to just say a word here -- normally  the press in Washington focuses on what we are fighting about and what the parties disagree about.
That same steely resolve and sense of high purpose have marked his entire astonishing career.
We cannot  we will not  bargain it away to get strategic arms reductions.
We also will encourage service to country by creating new opportunities within the AmeriCorps and Senior Corps programs for public safety and public health efforts.
Now  the biggest difference here -- and it affects every one of you  from the wealthiest person here to the people who have served this wonderful meal this morning -- the biggest difference is their tax plan is three times bigger than ours.
From 9/11 to this hour  our principal concern has had to be that the terrorists will strike again  and that they will try use even deadlier weapons.
So then we would be united  we'd be working together  we'd be fighting the problems of the rest of the world together.
So we can have a great big tax cut at the top end.
This one is up to you.
However  the Senate agreed with me that we cannot leave those fighting for freedom in Nicaragua at the mercy of the Communist regime and expect the process toward democracy to move ahead.
On the right side  the Republican team is trying to change its uniform colors to blur the differences.
And it does not instill confidence.
Each year the pension will be increased by the amount by which prices have actually risen.
Three years ago this week  I stood before your convention and said nothing would mean more to me as President than to live up to your trust.
Remarkable treatments exist  and that's good.
You guys are at the cutting edge.
In conclusion  Madam President  may I say that the British Presidency during the last six months is to be congratulated on the number of Ministers who have come to this House.
It's a fundamentally new approach to creating jobs that are not exportable  that pay a decent living union wage  and allow people to be able to turn to their kids and say  honey  it's going to be okay.
And I know the results have proven that something I learned back in the cavalry is true  and that is  that there's nothing so good for the inside of a person as the outside of a horse.
We establish no religion in this country  we command no worship  we mandate no belief  nor will we ever.
That's why we're making an $11 billion investment through the recovery plan to modernize the way we distribute electricity.
After all  for America to compete and to win in the 21st century  we know that we will need a highly educated workforce that is second to none.
No  I think that's an excellent idea.
Our opponents can't campaign on jobs or heath care or fiscal responsibility.
What we want to see drawn are not immense details but certain legal boundary lines  within which the Trade Union Movement can fulfil its proper role.
You can't all of you get your own way.
I do not believe in an America divided by envy  each of us challenging the other's success.
If anybody knows a racist  I do.
While fighting raged on one side of the continent  tens of thousands of Americans from all walks of life came together on the other.
Well  the only way it could be worked out and the timing and all was that I had to put the tux on first.
With us today is the family of a young Marine who was killed while serving in Iraq.
All right.
And what does that have to do with this governor's race?
﻿  Speech to European Parliament
Some have literally slept in the mud.
Three years ago the ominous signs were everywhere.
All of those countries pretty nearly doubled the economic growth of the United States last year.
In 1963 President Kennedy amended the award for distinguished civilian service in peace time.
Let me just say one other thing.
We have incredible food and music and are surrounded by great friends.
We've got young-at-heart people like Robert Chambers  who finish out careers in business or health care or education  and instead of transitioning into retirement  they're just too busy  they're too restless  so they come back for an encore  plowing a lifetime of experience into helping people in need.
For those between 18 and 65  I think we ought to have a health care system that's built on the present employer-based system.
Nothing  to the rebuilding of the American economy  to dealing with our healthcare crisis and to fighting the war on terror.
Think of what we could do in America to close the economic divide if we could close the digital divide  if usage and access to computers and connections to the Internet were as dense as telephone ownership and usage.
We've worked hard these last few years to put the battle against abject poverty higher on the world's agenda  and America must keep it there.
Now  it's often said that foreign affairs are of no interest to the ordinary man and certainly play no part in a British general election.
I think he's had a bigger impact on the lives and health and the future of the American people than any person who ever held the job of FDA Commissioner before him  and I thank him very much.
-- -- to expand the chances of peace and prosperity in the future?
But I'll tell you something -- if it were up to them  every American would have health care tonight  every child would go to bed tonight not worrying whether or not there would be a doctor there if the baby woke up at 3:00 o'clock in the morning.
We did have a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans  but it's still -- the rates are well below where they were in 1980.
And with three of the Soviet Union's successor states now becoming non-nuclear and the tension between the U.S. and Russia over nuclear matters declining  we still must not forget that the threat of weapons of mass destruction remain in the continuing disputes we have over North Korea  and elsewhere with countries who seek either to develop or to sell or to buy such weapons.
I don't know of a single person that isn't complaining about the high price of gasoline.
We're also trying to work on another part of the agenda that has been on everybody's mind  which is public diplomacy.
I want to reaffirm to you what I said to all the American people early this morning: Our objectives there are limited  but our interests are clear -- to demonstrate once again that reckless acts have consequences  to reduce Saddam's ability to strike out again at his neighbors  to increase America's ability to prevent future acts of violence and aggression.
At every rally across our country young people in great numbers could be seen and heard.
And by acting in the best traditions of duty and honor  you're making our country and your Commander-in-Chief incredibly proud.
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations.
It is the same old standard under which the rank and file are judged.
So make it soon  sometime before October.
It's a culture that tells us that our lives should be easy  that we can have everything we want right now without a lot of effort; that struggle and sacrifice aren't necessary for success.
Well  by 1980  taxes were making our economy bleed.
You've got the people themselves that are willing to rise up and to confront the disease.
The same is true of a family or a community or a nation.
﻿  Remarks by the Vice President at An Event for Bush-Cheney '04
If you can start having a bunch of kids who didn't have to have diabetes  with adult onset diabetes  I tell you  you've got a serious problem on your hands.
If you think about this for a minute there are really only two major parties in America  and we've seen what one party will do over the last six years.
None of us can know every turn that lies ahead for America in the fight against terror.
We can't get this done if we're not willing to build a global economic system and tear down these trade barriers and trade with people more and give them access to our markets and try to get our technology and our investments into their markets and build the right kind of partnership.
That came home to me on Flight 93  when Americans were on an airplane  they got the word that they were -- the enemy was going to use the airplane as a weapon.
They have brought us closer to our one America in the 21st century.
Our Global AIDS Coordinator  Ambassador Tobias  asked me to send everyone his warm congratulations and his appreciation for your partnership.
All that you've achieved  I believe that the CIA's best days are still yet to come.
And as long as our country and the world is around  unless there is some completely unforeseen change in human nature  our successors will have to do the same.
In short  we're headed for a second boom.
I always recall -- looking down out of the hotel on Sydney Harbor this morning -- the events 15 years ago when we marked the 50th anniversary of the Coral Sea Battle  and I came down as Secretary of Defense and brought an aircraft carrier battle group with me.
Those are basic principles that we should all be able to agree on -- unless you're thinking about the next election instead of the next generation.
The perfect example of that was Afghanistan.
So now we've got millions of our fellow Americans swept up in that disaster -- hardworking people who've been left to sit idle for months and even years as their lives have been turned upside down.
I thank Hillary and Al and Tipper.
And my job is to stop as many of those riders as I can.
So  we took action to bring runaway government spending under control.
So instead of moaning about this or throwing up your hands about this  let's get about the business at hand.
﻿  Remarks by the President and Lee Brown  Director of Office of National Drug Control Policy
I'm proud to call him  fellow citizen to America.
I want to thank the First Lady and all the people who work with her.
But if they don't want to fight on their record  they certainly won't want to fight on their policies as approved by the Labour Party's last Scottish Conference.
But this stops in its tracks federal action that protects the environment  protects consumers  and protects workers.
The President laid out an historic vision of two democratic states  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security and he made it the policy of the United States.
But they sense  deep in their bones  that with just a slight change in priorities  we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all.
Let me offer an example.
We agree.
It's a simple goal.
To all the good Democrats who respect that tradition of their party  I say  "You're not alone."
No one has done more than she to teach us that the desire for liberty is universal  that it is a matter of conscience  not culture.
My opponent has got a different view when it comes to health care.
Or so they claim.
This is a shared responsibility.
We have come to such a moment.
President Bush has recognized this from the beginning.
He's worked with us on the creation of jobs  and he knows very well  and we all know  what Washington State's role is in creating a strong national defense.
So we drove over from San Jose  and Leon and Bruce Lindsey and I were sitting in the car together and the closer we got to Salinas the happier Leon got.
We know that we have an absolute moral obligation to try and try again.
Four years ago we began to navigate by certain fixed principles.
And massive deficits also paralyzed the Congress in their attempts to invest in our future  as we spent more and more and more of the taxpayers' dollars just to pay interest on the debt we had run up.
And while a lot of folks are still hurting  and they are  and we still have a long way to go  we are finally heading in the right direction.
They will have to be a publicprivate partnership.
And we have to work on this.
And I find it completely amazing that five-eighths of my presidency is behind me.
We see an America in which every day is Independence Day  July 4th.
As it is right now  the jobs picture is the best in our history; more Americans are working today than ever before.
And I know to be here  taking pay cuts as many of you do  you've got to be doing it because of passion because all of you all would be at a firm somewhere if it didn't mean something to you.
But we've got a lot of these people in our computers.” You say  “So what?
We're seeing -- with the same strategies there that have worked here  community policing and careful targeting of certain kinds of crime in certain areas.
I know many of you have faced more than your fair share of hardships and adversities.
And it still threatens our prosperity.
As the Vice President and I said in a book we put out in the election campaign in 1992  our economic strategy includes a commitment to work to provide decent  safe  affordable homes to all Americans  and to do it with an alliance of the public and private sector.
One way  for example  that we've paid that price has been in the wider and wider availability of pornography.
And so  my friends  1998  no less than 1989  demands our boldness  our will and our unity.
You just heard a little bit about it.
And we did this because we know the vital role fathers play in the lives of our children.
Every President since this country assumed global responsibilities has known that those responsibilities could only be met if we pursued a bipartisan foreign policy.
We have to prove we can grow the economy and preserve  indeed  enhance the environment.
And this is just the beginning.
We worked so hard to save the Everglades.
We said that if we got the Government's finances under control  if we got inflation down  that if we got taxes reduced  the economy would respond.
Just to pay for the spending promises he made will require a tax increase of almost $2 000 for every household.
It can't be more than about 3% of your overall body weight and why would you want to take all that trouble and attention when the other 95  97% is OK?
Hopefully we can do more and more of this.
There's a figure that most people are not familiar with.
There is always the temptation to forget this -- to carry ourselves with an air of entitlement  as if good things come to us by right.
The air is cleaner  the water is cleaner  the food is safer; we've got 90 percent of our children immunized for the first time in history; we've set aside more land in preservation than any administration in the history of America  except those of the two Roosevelts.
But there is yet another test of whether we are serious about achieving results by 1992.
We talked to the families that are moving into those homes.
And the sheriff said  "Elmer  do you realize you've just committed a felony?"
Oh  sure  the role of government is to help the poor and help the elderly with medicine -- but it's not to try to create overall wealth.
We should begin with the fight against terror in Afghanistan and here at home.
We have got to get this right.
One of the reasons I work with Max to -- on free trade is because I believe when we open up markets for products  U.S. products  Montana products  people are going to more likely be able to find a job.
Individuals did it  individuals with a pioneer spirit  not government.
We have a lot of work to do.
But it is not enough merely to bring down inflation.
I know that others are giving discounts to certain people.
I never asked him and he never asked me to discard our convictions where we honestly disagreed.
We know we have to have more courses offered  we know we have to train the teachers better  we know we have to find more funds for these shortage areas.
Inflation has plummeted from more than the double-digit figure that Ken told you about to  now  1.8 percent.
But what Ryan showed was the same courage and strength that so many HIV-positive activists have shown over the years and shown around -- show around the world today.
Let us go after more Conservative membs.
Your energy strategy is a very good start and I thank you for it.
It talks about the need to conserve  and to use technologies to bring more efficiencies to the use of energy.
You read of -- a brownfield is a place almost always in a city where people used to make money and they left and it's now polluted and people can't afford to go in and make money there again.
But if you hold the view which I hold  that this is a dangerous time  that this is a time of challenge and opportunity  that this is a time that requires the best of us  that the United States has failed to recognize in its leadership that these are changing and different times  in a in America  Africa  and Asia  in Western Europe and Eastern Europe  in outer space  in our own country - I note no sense of vitality.
I don't think we should write a plan that basically is designed to please the people who are selling the drugs instead of the people who are buying the drugs.
The Soviet policy was a policy of expansionism either by military might  by subversion or by threat or by proxy through the Cubans  and we began to say: "This is their policy and we simply must ourselves have a firm defence policy in defence of freedom and be staunch allies of NATO and we must watch what happens in the Soviet Union very carefully indeed!"
Troops from all across our NATO nations speak different languages  from different ethnic and religious backgrounds they come.
-- and in public  no less.
But please keep loaning me money at low interest rates so I can cover Bill Clinton's tax cut.” I just don't think it's right.
We believe you can be pro-work and pro-family.
But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.
You may recall that Burke had a phrase for it  as always:- "All that is needed for evil men to triumph is for good men to do nothing."
By the way  this isn't a new idea that I'm talking about -- Galveston County  Brazoria County  Matagorda County has got it right here.
This underscores a fact that I've seen in the faces of our troops from Baghdad to Bagram -- in the 21st century  our women in uniform play an indispensable role in our national defense.
And people kept saying  well  it just doesn't seem like your tax plan is getting much steam.
But it does only say one thing: “Feed me!
And economic growth slows  and with it  the creation of new jobs and businesses.
And with Jim's help  we're going to do just that.
By 2015  there will be 30.
We've got to have you talking to your friends  we've got to have you talking to your neighbors  your coworkers.
We've had 4.3 million new jobs; manufacturing jobs increasing for almost a year now -- the longest period they've increased in a decade.
I love this country deeply.
I'm going to count on you not only for help such as the help you've given tonight  but I'm going to count on you to energize the grass-roots  to talk to your neighbors  talk to people who are making up their minds to put the signs in the yard and help spread our message  which is a message that's optimistic and hopeful  a message that speaks to all Americans.
He died at the World Trade Center when he went into the -- into the destruction to save men and women.
And she was once asked if being a women posed a disadvantage in public life and said  "Only when I'm climbing trees."
It occurred just a few days ago  and some of our young Americans were already here working on the trip.
Well  because  again  of the moral collapse of our leadership.
Okay.
Ditto.
﻿  Speech at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee
Those who have it do well; those who don't are in trouble.
Nothing we say or do will bring them back; perhaps nothing we can say or do can ease the pain of their families or the sorrow in your hearts.

When the Prime Minister spoke I was in London still and I watched it on television  as I have most of this Conference.
We don't want the federal government to engage in some power grab.

Also  since you know that it's almost impossible for us to get the cooperation of the press in getting our meetings publicized  the only way that people in Harlem will know that we're having meetings is if you inform them.
We do it because we felt it has to be done.”
And that expands the economy  creating new businesses  new jobs  and new wealth.

We hired a newspaper reporter who later became H. R. Gross  the conscience of the United States Congress in his many years as a Congressman here.
They're mistaken.
And we've seen this sort of thing happen.

The first side of what we have to look at is not so pleasant  is it?
So  yes  the new beginning we seek is not only possible  it has already begun.
We're not turning back.
So we have responsibilities to ourselves  but we owe a lot to each other.
Now  last week  in response to a mandate from the United States Supreme Court  the Environmental Protection Agency determined that carbon dioxide and other tailpipe emissions are harmful to the health and well-being of our people.
The title of that conference was Culture Counts  and I think that -- culture has always counted.
And the whole goal is to help them -- we can't replace the lives they've lost  but we can honor the sacrifices they've made by helping them to build their areas back better; to have better housing  better education  better health care  stronger communities  and a more diversified economy.
Either you can subscribe to the American creed which says that God endowed us with our rights  or you can subscribe to the abortion creed which says that those rights are the consequences of our mother's will.
And I want to keep -- I hope when I'm gone that this thing will have enough life that other people will keep doing it.
And unfortunately some in my own party have aided and abetted in the country going in the wrong direction.
Whether it's a grandmother volunteering at the church day care center or a member of the Kiwanis Club at the charity car wash  much is being accomplished  and we think it should be encouraged.
Those are schools that provide healthy meals  offer physical education and nutrition education  and ensure that children receive the free and reduced price meals that they're eligible for.
I tried to keep track and make sure they were all working 40 hours a week.
They taught me that everyone has a story.
These are the ways we  the American people  can be prepared to meet this challenge.
The stakes are high for America's families.
The United States will continue to take the lead in NATO  especially in the southern region where the most immediate threats to peace exist.
This competition will not be based on politics or ideology or the preferences of a particular interest group.
Now the economy is adding private sector jobs and has been for six straight months.
And they will not succeed.
Schools and communities all across America responded  and we're beginning to see the results.
Let me shift over  if I can  and spend a few minutes on the national security side  and some of those issues as we contemplate the choice we're going to make on November 2nd.

Working with strong allies on Capitol Hill  the President signed into law significant tax relief for millions of American families and businesses.
I would like to ask you to join me in urging your Senators and Members of Congress to approve that plan swiftly.
There's a lot on the agenda.
They'll bring our country together.
This combination of conditions has not existed before  at least in my lifetime.
And there are other times when circumstances have changed enough in the world that we really need to sit down and make some fundamental decisions about the direction the country is headed in  where we're faced with fundamental choices.
And you're the first pitcher ever to win the Most Valuable Player Award for both the league championship and World Series in the same year.
